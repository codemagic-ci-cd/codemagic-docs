You can speed up your builds by storing dependencies on Codemagic. To use caching, you must **enable dependency caching** in app settings. Note that caching is workflow-specific.


You can add paths to be cached, for example:

| **Path**                                    | **Description**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `$FLUTTER_ROOT/.pub-cache`                  | Dart cache                                       |
| `$HOME/.gradle/caches`                      | Gradle cache. Note: do not cache `$HOME/.gradle` |
| `$HOME/Library/Caches/CocoaPods`            | CocoaPods cache                                  |

Caching `$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` won't help to speed up iOS builds with Xcode 10.2 or later.

## Enabling dependency caching

1. In your app settings, open the **Dependency caching** section.
2. Check the **Enable dependency caching** option. By default, caching is disabled.
3. Enter the path(s) to the dependencies to be cached and click **Add**. Note that you can delete added paths anytime.
4. Click **Save** to save the settings.

## Removing cashed dependencies

In order to clear the collected cache, navigate to the **Dependency caching** section in app settings and click **Clear cache**. During the next build, dependencies will be downloaded afresh.
