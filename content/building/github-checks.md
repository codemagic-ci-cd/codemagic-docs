In addition to the regular CI status checks, you can set up [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-protected-branches) for a repository to block merging a pull request when the build fails, Codemagic will report

In order to enable GitHub Checks, repository needs to be connected with GitHub App (or user has GitHub App integration while team doesnâ€™t have GitHub OAuth integration). That is it :)
In order to block branches from being merged to master in PR: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-protected-branches
