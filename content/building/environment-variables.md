Environment variables are useful for storing information that you do not want to store in the repository, such as your credentials or workflow-specific data. In addition, you can make use of a number of read-only environment variables that Codemagic exports to customize your builds.

## Adding environment variables

You can add environment variables in **App settings > Environment variables**.

1. Enter the name and the value of the variable.
2. Check **Secure** if you wish to hide the value in the UI and build logs and disable editing of the variable. Such variables can be accessed only by the builder VMs during the build.
3. Click **Add**.

To access a variable, add the `$` symbol in front of its name. For example, access `API_TOKEN` by using `$API_TOKEN`. Note that it is required to use quotation marks with multi-line variables when you are referencing them in custom scripts, as shown in the example below:

    > MY_VAR="var
    > value"
    > echo $MY_VAR
    < var value
    > echo "$MY_VAR"
    < var
    < value

## Codemagic read-only environment variables

Codemagic exports several read-only environment variables during the build that you can use in scripts to customize the build process. Environment variables added by user will override Codemagic defaults. You can check which environment variables are exported by inserting the following script before or after any of the default build steps:

    #!/bin/sh
    set -ex
    printenv

Here you'll find some of the read-only environment variables explained.
