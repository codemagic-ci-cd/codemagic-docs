Environment variables are useful for storing information that you do not want to store in the repository, such as your credentials or workflow-specific data. In addition, you can make use of a number of read-only environment variables that Codemagic exports to customize your builds.

{{<notebox>}}
You can add environment variables in the [environment](../getting-started/yaml/#environment) section of the `codemagic.yaml` configuration file or in the [Environment variables](../flutter/env-variables/) section in the Flutter workflow editor.

See how to [encrypt sensitive information](./encrypting) in Codemagic.

## Codemagic read-only environment variables

Codemagic exports several read-only environment variables during the build that you can use in scripts to customize the build process. Environment variables added by user will override Codemagic defaults. You can check which environment variables are exported by inserting the following script before or after any of the default build steps:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
set -ex
printenv
```

Here you'll find some of the read-only environment variables explained.

`$FCI_ARTIFACT_LINKS` environment variable value is a JSON encoded list in the following form:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Codemagic_Release.ipa",
    "type": "ipa",
    "url": "https://api.codemagic.io/artifacts/2e7564b2-9ffa-40c2-b9e0-8980436ac717/81c5a723-b162-488a-854e-3f5f7fdfb22f/Codemagic_Release.ipa",
    "md5": "d2884be6985dad3ffc4d6f85b3a3642a",
    "versionName": "1.0.2",
    "bundleId": "io.codemagic.app"
  }
]
```

## Using environment variables

To access a variable, add the `$` symbol in front of its name. For example, access `API_TOKEN` by using `$API_TOKEN`. Note that it is required to use quotation marks with multi-line variables when you are referencing them in custom scripts.

## Accessing environment variables from your application

The following examples show how to place your Google Maps API key into an Android or iOS application from an environment variable. With this approach you will not have to store your secret key in the repository.

1. Add your key as an environment variable with the name `MAPS_API_KEY`

### Android

2. Read the key from an environment variable to `build.gradle`

```gradle
defaultConfig {
    // Other values set here
    resValue "string", "maps_api_key", "$System.env.MAPS_API_KEY"
}
```

3. Read the key from the `build.gradle` value to `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="@string/maps_api_key"
/>
```

### iOS (Swift)

2. Read the key from the environment variable to `Info.plist`

```xml
<key>MAPS_API_KEY</key>
<string>$(MAPS_API_KEY)</string>
```

3. Read the key from the `Info.plist` value to `AppDelegate.swift`

```swift
GMSServices.provideAPIKey(Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "MAPS_API_KEY") as? String ?? "")
```

### iOS (Objective-C)

2.  Read your key from the environemnt variable to `AppDelegate.m` as in the [example](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/packages/google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter/example/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m).

```objective-c
[GMSServices provideAPIKey:[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] environment][@"MAPS_API_KEY"]];
```
