Public dashboards make it possible for teams to share the list of team's builds, release notes (if passed) and build artifacts with people outside Codemagic using a public link (build logs will not be exposed). This is a convenient option for distributing builds to testers or sharing build artifacts with stakeholders.

The public dashboards feature is available for teams only. It is not possible to create public dashboards for apps on personal accounts.

## Enabling public dashboards

To use public dashboards, team owners will have to enable the feature in team settings. 

In team settings, expand the **Public dashboards** section and click **Enable sharing**. This will allow any team member to create dashboards and generate public links to share them.

Public dashboards can be disabled anytime by clicking **Disable sharing**.

## Creating and sharing a build dashboard

Open the **Builds** page via the navigation bar and use the **team**, **application**, **workflow**, **branch** and **status** filters on the left sidebar to create a build dashboard. Then click **Share dashboard** at the top of the page to generate a public link. A popup with the generated link will appear, and you can copy the link to the clipboard. The generated link will be also saved to the **Public dashboards** section in team settings.

Please note that anyone with the public link can access the build dashboard and download build artifacts.

## Managing links

All generated links to public dashboards are listed in the **Public dashboards** section in team settings. 

Links can be revoked by deleting them or when a team owner disables sharing by clicking **Disable sharing**. When sharing is re-enabled, the available links become active again.
