Create custom release notes file(s) to notify users of the changes as you publish a new version of your app.

Release notes can be published to:

* **email**. The release notes will be included in the publishing email of a successful build if you have publishing to email configured in the `publishing` section of your workflow.
* **Slack**. The release notes will be included in the Slack notification of a successful build if you have publishing to Slack configured in the `publishing` section of your workflow.
* **App Store Connect**. The release notes will be published to the What to Test field in TestFlight if you have publishing to App Store Connect configured in the `publishing` section of your workflow.
* **Google Play**. The release notes will be published to Google Play Console if you have publishing to Google Play configured in the `publishing` section of your workflow.

## Setting up release notes

There are three supported options to set up release notes:

1. Create a `release_notes.txt` file and add it to your project working directory, which is either the repository root directory or the `working_directory` specified in the root of your workflow configuration. Codemagic will fetch the content of that file and publish it with the build.
    * For email and Slack it will be published as is.
    * For Google Play it will be published under `en-US` language localization code.

For App Store Connect supported languages and codes are listed [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/betabuildlocalizationcreaterequest/data/attributes). For Google Play Console supported languages and codes are listed [here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/4419860?hl=en).

2. Create a `release_notes_<language_localization_code>.txt` file for every language used, e.g. `release_notes_en-GB.txt`, `release_notes_it.txt`, and add them to your project working directory, which is either the repository root directory or the `working_directory` specified in the root of your workflow configuration.
   * Release notes with `en-US` language code will be published to email and Slack in case file with `en-US` language code exists. If not, the first found release notes will be published.
   * For both App Store Connect and Google Play, only the release notes with the supported language codes will be published, omitting language codes that are not supported.

3. Create a `release_notes.json` file with the following content:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "language": "en-GB",
            "text": "British English release notes text"
        },
        {
            "language": "en-US",
            "text": "The US English release notes text"
        }
    ]
    ```

   Add this file to your project working directory, which is either the repository root directory or the `working_directory` specified in the root of your workflow configuration. Notes with missing `language` or `text` fields will not be taken into account.

    * Release notes with `en-US` language code will be published to email and Slack, given that a file with `en-US` language code exists. If not, the first release notes will be published.
    * For both App Store Connect and Google Play, only the release notes with the supported language codes will be published, omitting language codes that are not supported.
