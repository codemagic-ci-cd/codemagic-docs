By default, Codemagic builds are set to time out after 60 minutes. You can decrease or increase the maximum build duration **per workflow**.

* In `codemagic.yaml`, the build timeout limit can be defined in the [workflow section](../getting-started/yaml#workflows). 
* For Flutter projects configured via the workflow editor, you can adjust the maximum build duration in **App settings > Workflow settings > Max build duration**. Move the slider right or left to increase or decrease the maximum build duration. The minimum build duration is 30 min and the maximum is 120 min.

Note that builds that end with a timeout do not consume any build minutes.
