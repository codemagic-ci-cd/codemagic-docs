Welcome to the Codemagic documentation site!

Here you'll find some essential information for setting up CI/CD for your Flutter app with [Codemagic](https://codemagic.io/). You'll also find step-by-step guides on various topics on our [blog](https://blog.codemagic.io/categories/tutorials/ 'Codemagic blog - Tutorials').

The content of this site is constantly evolving. We're continuously updating it to provide more details and include new features.

You are more than welcome to join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/flutterci/shared_invite/enQtNDcwODIzMjM4MzI2LWJhNWRkMjZlMjk1YzgzNGUwZjQ5NmUxYTI3YjQzODdlMGU1Nzg5OWQ3NGM3NDdhNGIyNjY1YTUzZTgyNTJkMTc 'Slack community for CI/CD and Flutter') to reach out to us and meet fellow Flutter enthusiasts.
