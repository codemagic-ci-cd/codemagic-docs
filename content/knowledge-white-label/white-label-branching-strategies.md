There are many different ways you can set up your branching strategy and workflows for white labeling apps. What follows is a recommendation for getting started which you can use as the basis of your own strategy.

## Dev branch and workflow

This "dev" branch is for developing and fixing the core version of the app. The app is built using the default “dev” icons, colors, fonts, bundle id etc. and no white label automation scripts are run to change this app. 

When new code is committed to this branch, it triggers a "dev-release" workflow that runs unit or integration tests. If the tests pass, the core app is built and developers can download it directly from the Codemagic build page or shared dashboard, via email or Slack notifications, Testflight, Google Play, or other distribution channels. 

If any of integration or unit tests fail, the developers should review the code, fix any issues and commit new code to trigger a new build.

PASS --> BUILD

## QA branch and workflow

If you are happy with the build from the "dev" branch, you can now proceed to raise a PR request to merge this into the "QA" branch. This triggers a "qa-release" workflow that runs the white label automation scripts to change the icons, images, fonts, etc. to something other than the default dev version of the app. The resulting build can be distributed directly to your QA testers.

## Trigger branch and workflow

The "trigger" branch and workflow serve one purpose; to trigger the builds for each client version. When a pull request is merged into this branch from the "QA" branch it will trigger a "trigger" workflow which is configured to trigger all your client builds using the Codemagic REST API.

{{< /mermaid >}}

## Client build triggered by Codemagic REST API

Each client version build is triggered by the Codemagic REST API. The payload of the API request contains the client version to build and the workflow downloads the required assets and configuration for that version. This means that a **single workflow** is required to build multiple client versions. The workflow runs the white label automation scripts, builds the app, and automatically distributes the app to the channel of your choice.
