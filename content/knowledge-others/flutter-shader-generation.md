Flutter provides command line tools for app developers to collect shaders in the **SkSL** (Skia Shader Language) format that end users may require. The SkSL shaders can then be bundled into the app and pre-compiled when an end-user first launches the app, reducing compilation jank in subsequent animations.

You can check the official Flutter documentation for more details [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/shader).

Steps to build with Flutter shader compilation.

1. Build the app in `profile` mode in your local machine with **actual device connected**. Play around with the app to trigger as many animations as you need, especially the ones with compilation jank.

{{< highlight bash "style=paraiso-dark">}}
flutter run --profile --cache-sksl --purge-persistent-cache
{{< /highlight >}}

2. Press **M** at the `flutter run` command line to save the captured SkSL shaders to a file called `flutter_01.sksl.json` in your root directory.

3. Commit the file to your Github Repository.

4. Build the app with SkSL warm-up with your Codemagic Workflow by passing the additional argument `--bundle-sksl-path flutter_01.sksl.json` to your build command. For e.g

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
  scripts:
    - name: Build Flutter
      script: | 
        flutter build ipa --bundle-sksl-path flutter_01.sksl.json
{{< /highlight >}}

**Note:** The flutter profile mode is available only on actual iOS/Android Devices. It might not run properly on the simulator/emulator. You can check the official Flutter documentation for the flutter profile mode [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter%27s-modes).
