When you have moved your repository or need to update the username/password or private key used to access it, you can change the access details in **App settings > Repository settings > Repository access settings**. **Repository access settings** will be present only if apps are added via URL using HTTP/HTTPS or SSH keys. You can also generate a new private key in the settings section. Once you have changed the relevant settings, click **Update access settings** and then Codemagic will verify that it has access to the repository using the updated details before saving the settings.
