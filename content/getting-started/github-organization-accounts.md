Organizations can restrict access to third-party OAuth applications. As a member, you can request that organization admins authorize the application for use in that organization.

1. In your GItHub settings, navigate to **Organization settings** > **Third-party access**.
2. If you don't see Codemagic listed there, go to **Personal settings** > **Applications** > **Authorized OAuth Apps**.
3. Click on the Codemagic app.
4. Under **Organization access**, click **Request access** > **Request approval from owners**.
