Add applications from any self-hosted or cloud-based Git repository. For the best integration with the Git provider, it's recommended to connect your GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab repositories using the repository integration. However, you can also add repositories by entering the clone URL of the repository. 

To get started, click **Add application** in the top right corner of the Applications page. 

## Adding apps from GitHub

Adding apps from GitHub requires authorizing Codemagic and installing the Codemagic CI/CD GitHub App to a GitHub account or an organization to be able to load the repositories.

1. Click **Add application** in the top right corner of the Applications page.
2. Select **GitHub** as the Git provider. If you have already set up the integration, click **Next: Select repository** and skip to step 4. If the GitHub integration has not been set up, you'll see click **Next: Authorize integration** instead. A new window appears for you to authorize Codemagic. Confirm the authorization by clicking **Authorize Codemagic CI/CD**.
3. In the next step, click **Install GitHub App** to set up the integration. A GitHub page opens in a new window. Select the account or an organization where to install the app and choose whether to give Codemagic access to all the repositories from this account or only selected ones. Finish the installation by clicking **Install & Authorize**.
4. Finally, set up the application by selecting the repository from the dropdown menu and specifying the project type. Click **Finish: Add application**. You will be then redirected to the app settings.

>See the getting started guides and [sample projects](../sample-projects/codemagic-sample-projects/) configured with [codemagic.yaml](../getting-started/yaml/) to set up your project. Alternatively, Flutter apps can be also configured using the [Flutter workflow editor](../flutter/flutter-projects/).

### Configuring the GitHub App integration

Codemagic uses the [Codemagic CI/CD GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/codemagic-ci-cd) to integrate with GitHub. To share your GitHub repositories with Codemagic, Codemagic GitHub App will have to be installed on the account or organization in GitHub from which you would like to build applications.

{{<notebox>}}
Note that the GitHub App integration can be connected separately for your personal account and each team. The integrations configured for your personal account apply to the apps that are not part of a team in Codemagic. While teams inherit the integrations from the team owner's personal account, it is highly recommended to set up repository integrations separately in team settings.
{{</notebox>}}

1. In your user or team settings in Codemagic, navigate to the Integrations section and locate the GitHub App integration. The next steps may vary slightly depending on whether you have already authorized Codemagic or have the Codemagic GitHub App installed.
2. Click **Connect** next to the GitHub App integration, and when redirected to GitHub, click **Authorize Codemagic**.
3. Back in the Integrations section, click **Finish installation** and then **Install app**. Note that at this stage you can also revoke your authorization of the app by clicking **Disconnect**.
4. A popup window opens for you to select the organization or account where to install the app. Pick the installation location. You can later install the app to additional accounts.
5. Then choose whether to share **All repositories** from the account or select the repositories to share by choosing **Select repositories only**.
6. Click **Install & Authorize** to finish installation (you may be asked to confirm that action by entering your password). If you do not have permission to install the app under an organization, you will see the button **Authorize & Request** instead. An approval from the organization owner or app manager is needed to authorize the installation.

### Managing connected GitHub accounts and organizations

In the Integrations section in your user or team settings, click **Manage integration > Configure**. You can then select an account to configure or install Codemagic GitHub App to additional accounts. The accounts that already have Codemagic GitHub App installed are marked with "Configure". 

![Integrations > GitHub App > Manage integration > Configure](../uploads/gh-app-conf.png)

You can also access the same settings in GitHub by going directly to [https://github.com/apps/codemagic-ci-cd](https://github.com/apps/codemagic-ci-cd) and clicking **Configure**.

These settings allow you to revisit your repository access configuration should you want to share access to additional repositories or revoke access to a previously shared repository. In addition, you can disconnect an account by clicking **Uninstall** in the danger zone.

If you revoke access to previously shared repositories, you will still see all your apps and build history but won't be able to build the apps to which Codemagic no longer has access. Such apps will be grayed out and will show up on the Applications page with the **Removed from repository** filter.

### Disconnecting Codemagic GitHub App integration

The Codemagic CI/CD GitHub App integration can be disabled by clicking **Manage integration > Disconnect** in **User settings > Integrations > GitHub App** for your personal account or in **Team settings > Team Integrations > GitHub App** to disconnect it from the team. This will delete the GitHub access token that Codemagic had stored which means we no longer interact with GitHub.

To completely remove the integration, **uninstall** the Codemagic CI/CD app and revoke the authorization in GitHub. Visit [https://github.com/settings/installations](https://github.com/settings/installations) for personal accounts or github.com/organizations/your-organization/settings/installations for organization accounts to check whether Codemagic CI/CD is listed both under installed and authorized GitHub Apps.

### Repository is unavailable

Here are some tips on what to check if you can't see your repository listed in Codemagic or it's shown as unavailable.

* If you chose to grant access to **select repositories only** as opposed to all repositories when setting up the GitHub App, make sure you have also granted access to the repository in question. Click **Manage integration > Configure** in team or user integrations to configure repository access settings.
* Your personal Codemagic account and each team have separate integrations. Make sure you have connected the GitHub App integration to the right team or in your user settings.
* If you build apps from different GitHub accounts or organizations, make sure that you have installed the GitHub App on the account that has the repository available. Click **Manage integration > Configure** to see which accounts have been connected. You can also visit [https://github.com/settings/installations](https://github.com/settings/installations) for personal accounts or github(dot)com/organizations/your-organization/settings/installations for organization accounts to check whether Codemagic CI/CD is listed both under installed and authorized GitHub Apps.
* Private GitHub repositories can be shared with Codemagic only when the GitHub App is installed on the account that owns the repository. If you are a collaborator to a private repository, please ask the repository owner to install Codemagic GitHub App in GitHub: [https://github.com/apps/codemagic-ci-cd](https://github.com/apps/codemagic-ci-cd)

## Adding apps from Bitbucket

Adding apps from Bitbucket requires granting access to your Bitbucket account to enable the integration and load repositories.

1. Click **Add application** in the top right corner of the Applications page.
2. Select **Bitbucket** as the Git provider and click **Next: Authorize integration**. A new window appears for you to authorize Codemagic. Confirm the authorization by clicking **Grant access**. If you have already authorized Bitbucket, click **Next: Select repository** instead.
3. Set up the application by selecting the repository from the dropdown menu and specifying the project type. Click **Finish: Add application**. You will be then redirected to the app settings.

>See the getting started guides and [sample projects](../sample-projects/codemagic-sample-projects/) configured with [codemagic.yaml](../getting-started/yaml/) to set up your project. Alternatively, Flutter apps can be also configured using the [Flutter workflow editor](../flutter/flutter-projects/).

## Adding apps from GitLab

Adding apps from GitLab requires granting access to your GitLab account to enable the integration and load repositories.

1. Click **Add application** in the top right corner of the Applications page.
2. Select **GitLab** as the Git provider and click **Next: Authorize integration**. A new window appears for you to authorize Codemagic. Confirm the authorization by clicking **Authorize**. If you have already authorized GitLab, click **Next: Select repository** instead.
3. Set up the application by selecting the repository from the dropdown menu and specifying the project type. Click **Finish: Add application**. You will be then redirected to the app settings.

>See the getting started guides and [sample projects](../sample-projects/codemagic-sample-projects/) configured with [codemagic.yaml](../getting-started/yaml/) to set up your project. Alternatively, Flutter apps can be also configured using the [Flutter workflow editor](../flutter/flutter-projects/).

## Adding apps from other repositories

Apps that cannot be added via a repository integration can be cloned from a URL. Authentication for private repositories can be set up via HTTPS or SSH.
### Connecting repository via SSH

1. Click **Add application** in the top right corner of the Applications page.
2. Select **Other** and click **Next: Select repository**.
3. Enter the **Repository URL** for **cloning** the repository. You can find the URL from your repository by clicking **Clone** / **Clone or download**. Usually, the URL is in this format: `git@example.com:username/repo.git`.
4. Upload the **SSH private key** file. If your key is password-protected, enter the **Private key passphrase**.

   **Alternatively**, you can click **Generate key pair** and have Codemagic create an SSH key pair for you, read more about it [below](#generating-a-key-pair-in-codemagic).

5. Finish setting up the application by selecting the project type and clicking **Finish: Add application**. You will be then redirected to the app settings.

>See the getting started guides and [sample projects](../sample-projects/codemagic-sample-projects/) configured with [codemagic.yaml](../getting-started/yaml/) to set up your project. Alternatively, Flutter apps can be also configured using the [Flutter workflow editor](../flutter/flutter-projects/).

#### Generating a key pair in Codemagic

On clicking **Generate key pair**, Codemagic creates a secure 4096 bit SSH key pair. The private key will be used in Codemagic and the public key must be added to your repository settings. Click **Copy to clipboard** to copy the public key.

- If your repository is hosted on [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#setup-2), [GitLab](https://www.deployhq.com/support/projects/updating-your-project-repository/uploading-your-public-key-to-gitlab-manually) or [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-access-keys-294486051.html), add the public key to your repository's access/deployment keys.
- For self-hosted repositories, request your git server admins to allow access to the provided public key.

After you have added the public key to your repository settings, finish adding the app by clicking **Finish: Add application**.

{{<notebox>}}Don't close the module before you have finished adding the app, otherwise, you'll need to start over and generate a new SSH key.{{</notebox>}}

### Connecting repository via HTTP/HTTPS

1. Click **Add application** in the top right corner of the Applications page.
2. Select **Other** and click **Next: Select repository**.
3. Enter the **Repository URL** for **cloning** the repository. You can find the URL from your repository by clicking **Clone** / **Clone or download**. Usually, the URL is in this format: `https://example.com/path/to/repository.git`.
4. If your repository is private, then enter your **Username** and **Password**. In the case of a public repository, check **Public repository**.
5. Finish setting up the application by selecting the project type and clicking **Finish: Add application**. You will be then redirected to the app settings.

>See the getting started guides and [sample projects](../sample-projects/codemagic-sample-projects/) configured with [codemagic.yaml](../getting-started/yaml/) to set up your project. Alternatively, Flutter apps can be also configured using the [Flutter workflow editor](../flutter/flutter-projects/).

## Repositories behind a firewall

To allow Codemagic access the private repository, the following IP addresses need to be whitelisted:

1. `34.74.234.56` - used by our backend for getting basic information about the repository
2. `35.185.76.207` - used by our Linux build servers to download the code and build it
3. `199.7.162.128/29` - used by our macOS build servers to download the code and build it

## Modifying repository access settings

When you have moved your repository or need to update the username/password or private key used to access it, you can change the access details in **App settings > Repository settings > Repository access settings**. You can also generate a new private key. Once you have changed the relevant settings, click **Update access settings**. Codemagic will verify it has access to the repository using the updated details before saving the settings.
