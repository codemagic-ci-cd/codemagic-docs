With Codemagic, you can set up CI/CD for native Android or iOS, Flutter, React Native, Cordova and Ionic apps. 

The projects are configured using a highly customizable [codemagic.yaml](/yaml/yaml) configuration file which is stored in the repository. Alternativey, you can set up your Flutter projects in our intuitive [Flutter workflow editor](/flutter/configuration/flutter-projects).

Here are some quick links to help you get started.
