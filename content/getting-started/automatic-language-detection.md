Codemagic enables you to sort the list of apps detected in your repositories based on the repository language so you can display your Flutter apps only. This can be done if your apps have **Dart** set as the project language in GitHub/Bitbucket. While GitHub determines your project language automatically based on the files and directories in your repository, the project language for apps hosted on Bitbucket has to be set manually in the repository settings to benefit from this sorting option.

GitLab projects cannot be sorted by language as information about the programming language of GitLab projects is not available to Codemagic.
