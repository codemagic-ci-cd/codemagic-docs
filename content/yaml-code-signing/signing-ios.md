## Managing and uploading files

Team owner permissions are required to upload and edit files under the **Code signing identities** section. However, all team members can view the file info for any of the uploaded files.

### Creating the App Store Connect API key

Signing iOS applications requires [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) membership.

{{< include "/partials/app-store-connect-api-key.md" >}}

### Adding the App Store Connect API key to Codemagic

1. Open your Codemagic Team settings, go to **Team integrations** > **Developer Portal** > **Manage keys**.
2. Click the **Add key** button.
3. Enter the `App Store Connect API key name`. This is a human readable name for the key that will be used to refer to the key later in application settings.
4. Enter the `Issuer ID` and `Key ID` values.
5. Click on **Choose a .p8 file** or drag the file to upload the App Store Connect API key downloaded earlier.
6. Click **Save**.



### Adding the Code signing certificate

#### Uploading a certificate file

Codemagic lets you upload code signing certificates as PKCS#12 archives containing both the certificate and the private key which is needed to use it. When uploading, Codemagic will ask you to provide the certificate password (if the certificate is password-protected) along with a unique **Reference name**, which can then be used in the `codemagic.yaml` configuration to fetch the specific file.

1. Open your Codemagic Team settings, go to  **codemagic.yaml settings** > **Code signing identities**.
2. Open **iOS certificates** tab.
3. Upload the certificate file by clicking on **Choose a .p12 or .pem file** or by dragging it into the indicated frame.
4. Enter the **Certificate password** and choose a **Reference name**.
5. Click **Add certificate**

#### Generating a new certificate

If you have added the **App Store Connect API key** to Codemagic, you can also generate a new `Apple Development` or `Apple Distribution` certificate.

1. Open your Codemagic Team settings, go to  **codemagic.yaml settings** > **Code signing identities**.
2. Open **iOS certificates** tab.
3. Click **Generate certificate**.
4. Provide a **Reference name** for the certificate.
5. Choose the **Certificate type**.
6. Select the **App Store Connect API key** to use.
7. Click **Create certificate**.

Once the certificate has been created, Codemagic will allow you to download the certificate and provides the password for it.

{{<notebox>}}
**Note**: The certificate can be downloaded **only once**, right after creating it.
{{</notebox>}}
&nbsp;
{{<notebox>}}
**Note**: Apple limits the number of `Apple Distribution` certificates to 3. If you have already reached the maximum number of certificates, the following error will be displayed:

{{< highlight Shell >}}
There is a problem with the request entity - You already have a current Distribution certificate or a pending certificate request.
{{< /highlight >}}

Similar errors can also arise in rarer cases with `Apple Development` certificates. To resolve the error, either remove some old certificate from the Apple Developer Portal or upload an existing certificate manually.
{{</notebox>}}


#### Fetching a certificate from Apple Developer Portal

Existing signing certificates previously generated by Codemagic can be automatically fetched from Apple Developer Portal based on your team's App Store Connect API key.

Fetching a certificate that was not generated by Codemagic is not possible because each certificate is linked with a private signing key to which Codemagic has no access.

1. Open your Codemagic Team settings, go to  **codemagic.yaml settings** > **Code signing identities**.
2. Open **iOS certificates** tab.
3. Click **Fetch certificate**.
4. Select a certificate from the **Development certificates** or **Distribution certificates** list.
5. Click **Fetch selected**.


### Adding the provisioning profile

Codemagic allows you to upload a provisioning profile to be used for the application or to fetch a profile from the Apple Developer Portal.

The profile's type, team, bundle id, and expiration date are displayed for each profile added to Code signing identities. Furthermore, Codemagic will let you know whether a matching code signing certificate is available in Code signing identities (a green checkmark in the **Certificate** field) or not.

#### Uploading a provisioning profile

You can upload provisioning profiles with the `.mobileprovision` extension, providing a unique **Reference name** is required for each uploaded profile.

1. Open your Codemagic Team settings, go to  **codemagic.yaml settings** > **Code signing identities**.
2. Open **iOS provisioning profiles** tab.
3. Upload the provisioning profile file by clicking on **Choose a .mobileprovision file** or by dragging it into the indicated frame.
4. Enter the **Reference name** for the profile.
5. Click **Add profile**.

#### Fetching a provisioning profile from Apple Developer Portal

Alternatively, you can automatically fetch the provisioning profiles from the Apple Developer Portal based on your team's App Store Connect API key. The bundle identifier is listed for every available profile along with it's name.

The profiles are displayed grouped by category: `Development profiles`, `Ad Hoc profiles`, `App Store profiles`, and `Enterprise profiles`. For each selected profile, it is necessary to provide a unique **Reference name**, which can be later used in `codemagic.yaml` to fetch the profile.

1. Open your Codemagic Team settings, go to  **codemagic.yaml settings** > **Code signing identities**.
2. Open **iOS provisioning profiles** tab.
3. Click **Fetch profiles**
4. Select the desired profile(s) and enter a **Reference name** for each one.
5. Click **Download selected**. (scroll down if necessary)




## Referencing certificates and profiles in codemagic.yaml

Codemagic provides two means of fetching the required certificates and provisioning profiles during the build with the use of `codemagic.yaml`. Fetching can either be configured by specifying the distribution type and bundle identifier, or for more advanced use-cases, individual files can be fetched by their reference names.


### Fetching files by distribution type and bundle identifier

To fetch all uploaded signing files matching a specific distribution type and bundle identifier during the build, define the `distribution_type` and `bundle_identifier` fields in your `codemagic.yaml` configuration. Note that it is necessary to configure **both** of the fields.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  ios-workflow:
    name: iOS Workflow
    
    # ....
    
    environment:
      ios_signing:
        distribution_type: app_store # ad_hoc | development | enterprise
        bundle_identifier: com.example.id
    
    # ....
    
    scripts:
      
      # ...

      - name: Initialize keychain
        script: | 
          keychain initialize
      - name: Add certificates to keychain
        script: | 
          keychain add-certificates
{{< /highlight >}}


Note that when using the fields `distribution_type` and `bundle_identifier`, it is not allowed to configure `provisioning_profiles` and `certificates` fields.

Additionally, it is mandatory to specify `Initialize keychain` & `Add certificates to keychain` scripts as shown above.

When defining the bundle identifier `com.example.id`, Codemagic will fetch any uploaded certificates and profiles matching the extensions as well (e.g. `com.example.id.NotificationService`).


### Fetching specific files by reference names

For a more advanced configuration, it is possible to pick out specific uploaded profiles and certificates for Codemagic to fetch during the build. To do so, list the references of the uploaded files under the `provisioning_profiles` and `certificates` fields, respectively. Note than when fetching individual files, the fields `distribution_type` and `bundle_identifier` are not allowed.

Steps `Initialize keychain` & `Add certificates to keychain` scripts are not required as those are automatically fetched during the build process.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  ios-workflow:
    name: iOS Workflow
    
    # ....
    
    environment:
      ios_signing:
        provisioning_profiles:
          - profile_reference
          # - ...
        certificates:
          - certificate_reference
          # - ...
{{< /highlight >}}

Codemagic saves the files to the following locations on the build machine:

- Profiles: `~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles`
- Certificates: `~/Library/MobileDevice/Certificates`

It is additionally possible to include names for environment variables that will point to the file paths on the build machine.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  ios-workflow:
    name: iOS Workflow
    
    # ....
    
    environment:
      ios_signing:
        provisioning_profiles:
          - profile: profile_reference
            environment_variable: THIS_PROFILE_PATH_ON_DISK
          # - ...
        certificates:
          - certificate: certificate_reference
            environment_variable: THIS_CERTIFICATE_PATH_ON_DISK
          # - ...
{{< /highlight >}}


## Using provisioning profiles

To apply the profiles to your project during the build, add the following script before your build scripts:

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
  scripts:
    # ... your dependencies installation
    
    - name: Set up code signing settings on Xcode project
      script: xcode-project use-profiles
    
    # ... your build commands
{{< /highlight >}}
