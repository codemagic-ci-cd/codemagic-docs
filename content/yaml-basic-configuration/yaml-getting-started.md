`codemagic.yaml` is a highly customizable configuration file for setting up your CI/CD pipeline with Codemagic. Configure all your workflows in a single file and commit the file to version control.


{{< youtube er7hRWhW0B0 >}}

## Building with YAML

In order to use `codemagic.yaml` for build configuration on Codemagic, it has to be committed to your repository. The name of the file must be `codemagic.yaml` and it must be located in the root directory of the repository.

When detected in the repository, `codemagic.yaml` is automatically used for configuring builds triggered in response to the events defined in the file, provided that a [webhook](../building/webhooks) is set up. 

Builds can also be started manually by clicking **Start new build** in Codemagic and selecting the branch and workflow to build in the **Specify build configuration** popup.


{{<notebox>}}

Check out the [**cheatsheet**](/codemagic-yaml-cheatsheet.html) we have created to help you when using Codemagic YAML.

{{</notebox>}}

## Syntax

You can readily commit `codemagic.yaml` with the following content to test it out:

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  hello-world:
    name: Hello world workflow
    scripts:
        - echo "Hello World!"
{{< /highlight >}}

The scripts in the `scripts` section will be run right after the repository is cloned.

`codemagic.yaml` follows the traditional [YAML syntax](https://yaml.org/). Here are a few tips and tricks on how to better structure the file.

{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** You can use the Codemagic JSON schema to validate `codemagic.yaml` in your IDE. See how to set it up [here](../knowledge-base/validate-yaml/).
{{</notebox>}}

### Section names

For easier reading of the configuration file and build logs, you can divide the scripts into meaningful sections with descriptive names.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
scripts:
  - name: Build for iOS         # Name of the section
    script: flutter build ios   # The script(s) to be run in that section
{{< /highlight >}}

### Reusing sections

If a particular section would be reused multiple times in the file, e.g. in each workflow, you can avoid repetitions by using **anchors**. This is also convenient when you need to make changes to the code, as you would have to edit it in just one place. 

Define the section to be reused by adding `&` in front of it.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}

scripts:
  - &increment_build_number       # Defined section 
    name: Increment build number 
    script: agvtool new-version -all $(($PROJECT_BUILD_NUMBER +1))
{{< /highlight >}}

Reuse the defined section elsewhere by adding a `*` in front of it.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}

scripts:
  - script1
  - *increment_build_number       # Reused section
  - script3
{{< /highlight >}}

You can also define the reusable section under `definitions` by adding `&` in front of the section name.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}

definitions: 
  env_versions: &env_versions
    xcode: latest 
    cocoapods: default
{{< /highlight >}}

Expand the defined section elsewhere by using aliased mapping (`<<`) and adding a `*` in front of the section name.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows: 
  ios-release: 
    name: iOS release 
    environment: 
      << : *env_versions
{{< /highlight >}}

Here's a [sample](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/blob/main/yaml/yaml_anchors_aliases_sample/codemagic.yaml) `codemagic.yaml` that extensively uses anchors, aliases, and aliased mappings to reuse the sections in different workflows.

## Template

This is the skeleton structure of `codemagic.yaml`. Each section, along with the configuration options, is described in more detail 

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  my-workflow:
    name: My workflow name
    labels:
      - QA
      - ${TENANT_NAME}
    instance_type: mac_mini_m2
    max_build_duration: 60
    inputs: # more information about build inputs:https://docs.codemagic.io/knowledge-codemagic/build-inputs/
      name: # input ID
        description: Input description
        default: Codemagic
    environment:
      groups:
        - group_name
      vars:
        PUBLIC_ENV_VAR: "value here"
      flutter: stable
      xcode: latest
    cache:
      cache_paths:
        - ~/.pub-cache
    triggering:
      events:
        - push
      branch_patterns:
        - pattern: '*'
          include: true
          source: true
      cancel_previous_builds: false
    scripts:
      - echo "Hello, ${{ inputs.name }}"
      - ...
    artifacts:
      - build/**/outputs/bundle/**/*.aab
    publishing:
      email:
        recipients:
          - name@example.com
      scripts:
        - echo 'Post-publish script'
{{< /highlight >}}

### Workflows

You can use `codemagic.yaml` to define several workflows for building a project. Each workflow describes the entire build pipeline from triggers to publishing. For example, you may want to have separate workflows for developing, testing, and publishing the app.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  my-workflow:                   # workflow ID
    name: My workflow name       # workflow name displayed in Codemagic UI
    instance_type: mac_mini_m2   # machine instance type
    max_build_duration: 60       # build duration in minutes (min 1, max 120)
    environment:
    cache:
    triggering:
    scripts:
    artifacts: 
    publishing: 
{{< /highlight >}}

The main sections in each workflow are described below.

### Instance Type

`instance_type:` specifies the [build machine type](../specs/machine-type) to use for the build. The supported build machines are:
| **Instance Type** | **Build Machine** |
| ------------- | -----------------  |
| `mac_mini_m2`    | Apple silicon M2 Mac mini |
| `linux_x2`  | Linux |
| `windows_x2`  | Windows |

<br>
{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** Instance types `linux_x2` and `windows_x2` are only available for teams and users with [billing enabled](../billing/billing/). 
{{</notebox>}}

### Build inputs

Build inputs are parameters that allow you to customize your build configurations right before starting a new build without hardcoding them in **codemagic.yaml**. For example, build inputs can be used to determine whether to build the workflow for test or release purposes or which Xcode version to use, etc. More information about how to configure build inputs and examples can be found [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/knowledge-codemagic/build-inputs/).

### Environment

`environment:` section specifies the environment variables and their respective group and build machine software versions.

<br>
{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** Environment variables must belong to a group if environment variables are defined in the Codemagic app settings.
{{</notebox>}}

#### Environment variable groups

The snippet below shows how to import [environment variable groups](../building/environment-variable-groups/) defined in the team settings and application settings and also how to define them in the configuration file. Environment variables typically include credentials and API keys required for [code signing](../code-signing-yaml/signing). Click **Secure** to encrypt the values. Note that binary files have to be [`base64 encoded`](../yaml/configuring-environment-variables/#storing-sensitive-valuesfiles) locally before they can be saved to environment variables and decoded during the build.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
environment:
  groups:             # Define your environment variables groups here
    - keystore_credentials
    - app_store_credentials
    - manual_cert_credentials
    - firebase_credentials
    - other
    
    # Android code signing - Add the keystore_credentials group environment variables in Codemagic UI
    # (either in Application/Team variables)
    #     CM_KEYSTORE
    #     CM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
    #     CM_KEY_PASSWORD
    #     CM_KEY_ALIAS

    # iOS automatic code signing - Add the app_store_credentials group environment variables
    # in Codemagic UI (either in Application/Team variables)
    #     APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID
    #     APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER
    #     APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY
    #     CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY

    # iOS manual code signing - Add the manual_cert_credentials group environment variables
    # in Codemagic UI (either in Application/Team variables)
    #     CM_CERTIFICATE
    #     CM_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
    #     CM_PROVISIONING_PROFILE

    # Firebase secrets - Add the firebase_credentials group environment variables in Codemagic UI
    # (either in Application/Team variables
    #     ANDROID_FIREBASE_SECRET
    #     IOS_FIREBASE_SECRET
    
    # Add the other group environment variables in Codemagic UI 
    # (either in Application/Team variables
    #     SSH_KEY_GITHUB     # defining an ssh key used to download private dependencies
    #     CREDENTIALS        # publishing a package to pub.dev
    #     APP_CENTER_TOKEN   # publishing an application to App Center
{{< /highlight >}}

{{<notebox>}}
**Tip:** Store related variables in the same group so they can be imported to codemagic.yaml workflow in a single step. 
{{</notebox>}}
</p>
{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** If a group of variables is reusable for various applications, it can be defined in [Global variables and secrets](../variables/environment-variable-groups/#global-variables-and-secrets) in **Team settings** for easier access.
{{</notebox>}}

#### Workflow environment variables

The snippet below shows how to define workflow specific public environment variables. 

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
environment:
  vars:             # Define your environment variables here
    PUBLIC_ENV_VAR: "value here"
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Build machine and software versions

The snippet below shows how to specify the versions of Flutter, Xcode, CocoaPods, Node, npm, ndk, Java and Ruby used in the build.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
environment:
  flutter: stable   # Define the channel name, version (e.g. v1.13.4), or fvm for Flutter Version Management
  xcode: latest     # Define latest, edge or version (e.g. 11.2)
  cocoapods: 1.9.1  # Define default or version
  node: 12.14.0     # Define default, latest, current, lts, carbon (or another stream), nightly or version
  npm: 6.13.7       # Define default, latest, next, lts or version
  ndk: r21d         # Define default or revision (e.g. r19c)
  java: 1.8         # Define default, or platform version (e.g. 11)
  ruby: 2.7.2       # Define default or version (macOS only)
{{< /highlight >}}

Currently, only the above-mentioned software versions can be customized via the environment section in the yaml file. If a different software version needs to be customized, then it may require a different approach depending upon use cases.

{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** The Xcode version defines type of macOS build machine used for the build (even if you're building Android). See the default software versions on Codemagic macOS build machines [here.](../specs/versions-macos/)
{{</notebox>}}
</p>
{{<notebox>}}
**Note**: Using a non-default version of Ruby for macOS builds will increase the time of your `Preparing build machine` step significantly.
{{</notebox>}}

#### Environment section example

You can freely use all of the above features of environment section in conjunction.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
environment:
  vars: # Define your public environment variables here
    PUBLIC_ENV_VAR: "value here"
  groups: # Import UI defined environment variable groups(either in Application/Team variables) here
    - staging
  xcode: latest # Define latest, edge or version (e.g. 11.2)
  flutter: stable   # Define the channel name or version (e.g. v1.13.4)
{{< /highlight >}}

### Cache

`cache:` defines the paths to be cached and stored on Codemagic. For example, you may consider caching the following paths:

| **Path**                                    | **Description**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `$FLUTTER_ROOT/.pub-cache`                  | Dart cache                                       |
| `$HOME/.gradle/caches`                      | Gradle cache. Note: do not cache `$HOME/.gradle` |
| `$HOME/Library/Caches/CocoaPods`            | CocoaPods cache                                  |
| `$CM_BUILD_DIR`/node_modules                | Node cache                                       |

<br>

{{<notebox>}}

**Note:** Caching `$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` won't help speed up iOS builds with Xcode 10.2 or later.

{{</notebox>}}

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
cache:
  cache_paths:
    - ~/.gradle/caches
    - ...
{{< /highlight >}}
You can read more about configuring caching for your builds and its usage limits [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/knowledge-codemagic/caching/)

{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** Codemagic doesn't support caching symlinks.
{{</notebox>}}

{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** Each workflow has its own cache. It is possible to view the cache for each workflow under the **Caching** tab in the Codemagic UI.
{{</notebox>}}

### Triggering

{{<notebox>}}
**Note:** For automatic build triggering, it is required to configure a webhook in the repository. In your app settings, click **Create webhook** on the right sidebar under **Webhooks** to have Codemagic create a webhook. If you need to set up a webhook manually, refer [here](../building/webhooks) for details.
{{</notebox>}}

`triggering:` defines the events for automatic build triggering and watched branches. If no events are defined, you can start builds only manually.

A branch pattern can match the name of a particular branch, or you can use wildcard symbols to create a pattern that matches several branches. Note that for **pull request builds**, you have to specify whether the watched branch is the source or the target of the pull request.

To avoid running builds on outdated commits, you can set `cancel_previous_builds` to automatically cancel all ongoing and queued builds triggered by webhooks on push or pull request commit when a more recent build has been triggered for the same branch.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
triggering:
  events:                       # List the events that trigger builds
    - push
    - pull_request
    - pull_request_labeled      #GitHub only
    - tag
  branch_patterns:              # Include or exclude watched branches
    - pattern: '*'
      include: true
      source: true              # Applicable only to Pull Request triggers to determine if pattern is for source or target branch
    - pattern: excluded-target
      include: false
      source: false
    - pattern: included-source
      include: true
      source: true
  tag_patterns:                 # Include or exclude watched tag labels
    - pattern: '*'
      include: true
    - pattern: excluded-tag
      include: false
    - pattern: included-tag
      include: true
  cancel_previous_builds: false  # Set to `true` to automatically cancel outdated webhook builds
{{< /highlight >}}

Read more about configuring [additional conditions to run or skip](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-running-builds/starting-builds-automatically/#using-when-to-run-or-skip-builds) builds or build steps.
{{</notebox>}}

### Scripts

Scripts specify what kind of application is built. This is where you can specify the commands to [test](../testing-yaml/testing/), build and code sign your project (see our documentation for [iOS code signing](../code-signing-yaml/signing-ios) and [Android code signing](../code-signing-yaml/signing-android)). You can also run shell (`sh`) scripts directly in your `.yaml` file, or run scripts in other languages by defining the language with a shebang line or by launching a script file present in your repository.

When you set `ignore_failure` to `true`, the workflow will continue to run even if the script fails.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
scripts:
  - echo "single line script"
  - name: Flutter test
    script: flutter test
    ignore_failure: true
  - | 
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    print('Multiline python script')
  - name: Build for iOS
    script: flutter build ios
{{< /highlight >}}

There are example scripts available for building a [Flutter application](./building-a-flutter-app/), [React Native application](./building-a-react-native-app/), [native Android application](./building-a-native-android-app/) or a [native iOS application](./building-a-native-ios-app/).

By default, scripts are run after your app sources are fetched and the repository is cloned. To run scripts before the repository cloning step, use the pre_clone_scripts step:

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
    default-workflow:
        name: Default Workflow
        pre_clone_scripts:
          - name: Scripts to run before cloning the repository
            script: ...
        scripts:
            - name: Scripts to run after cloning the repository
              script: ...
{{< /highlight >}}

### Artifacts

Configure the paths and names of the artifacts you would like to use in the following steps, e.g. for publishing, or have available for download on the build page. All paths are relative to the clone directory, but absolute paths are supported as well. You can also use [environment variables](../building/environment-variables) in artifact patterns.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
artifacts:
  - build/**/outputs/apk/**/*.apk                   # relative path for a project in root directory
  - subfolder_name/build/**/outputs/apk/**/*.apk    # relative path for a project in subfolder
  - build/**/outputs/**/*.aab
  - build/**/outputs/**/mapping.txt
  - build/ios/ipa/*.ipa
  - build/macos/**/*.pkg
  - /tmp/xcodebuild_logs/*.log
  - flutter_drive.log
{{< /highlight >}}

There are several things to keep in mind about patterns:
* The pattern can match several files or folders. If it picks up files or folders with the same name, the top level file or folder name will be suffixed with `_{number}`.
* If one of the patterns includes another pattern, duplicate artifacts are not created.
* `apk`, `aab`, `aar`, `ipa`, `app`, `pkg`, proguard mapping (`mapping.txt`), `flutter_drive.log`, `jar`, `zip`, `xarchive` and `dSYM.zip` files will be available as separate items in the Artifacts section on the build page. The rest of the artifacts will be included in an archive with the following name pattern: `{project-name}_{version}_artifacts.zip`.

### Publishing

Codemagic has a number of integrations for publishing but you can also publish elsewhere with custom scripts. See the options under the [Publishing section](../publishing-yaml/distribution/).

Note that by default the publishing scripts are run regardless of the build status. You can specify additional conditions with if statements.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
publishing:
  email:
    recipients:
      - name@example.com
  scripts:
    name: Check for apk
    script: | 
      apkPath=$(find build -name "*.apk" | head -1)
      if [[ -z ${apkPath} ]]
      then
        echo "No .apk were found"
      else
        echo "Publishing .apk artifacts"
      fi
{{< /highlight >}}

You can also use the publishing scripts to report build status.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
scripts:
  - name: Report build start
    script: # build started

    . . .

  - name: Build finished successfully
    script: touch ~/SUCCESS
publishing:
  scripts:
    - name: Report build status
      script: | 
        if [ -a "~/SUCCESS" ] ; then
           # build successful
        else
           # build failed
        fi
{{< /highlight >}}


### Labels

You may use `codemagic.yaml` to define labels for your apps. Labels serve as additional information about the workflow you are building and are helpful when you have multiple versions of a workflow. The labels are visible on the `/builds` and `/app/<app-id>/build/<build-id>` pages. As shown in the snippet below, labels also support environment variables.

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  sample_workflow:
    name: My Workflow
    labels:
      - QA
      - ${TENANT_NAME}
{{< /highlight >}}

If you are building white label apps and use the Codemagic REST API to initiate your builds, labels should be passed as described [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/rest-api/builds/) because it is not possible to override environment variables that will be used as labels.
## Working directory

You may select a working directory globally for the entire workflow or individual scripts only. If not specified, the global working directory defaults to the directory where the repository is cloned (`/Users/builder/clone`). You can override the global working directory by specifying the working directory in the individual steps. Consider the example below:

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  build-apps:
    name: Build iOS and Android
    working_directory: mobile
    scripts:
      - name: Prepare
        script: pwd # current working directory is /Users/builder/clone/mobile
      - name: Build iOS
        working_directory: mobile/ios
        script: pwd # current working directory is /Users/builder/clone/mobile/ios
      - name: Build Android
        working_directory: mobile/android
        script: pwd # current working directory is /Users/builder/clone/mobile/android
      - name: Process Logs
        working_directory: /Users/builder/Library/Logs
        script: pwd # current working directory is /Users/builder/Library/Logs
{{< /highlight >}}

Working directory paths are relative to the repository clone directory, e.g. if `mobile` is the working directory, then the script will be executed in `/Users/builder/clone/mobile`.

Note that you can specify an absolute path as a working directory as well.
