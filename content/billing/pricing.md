## Pricing for Individuals
### 1. Free plan

Individuals receive **500 free minutes** per month on macOS M2 machines on a personal account. These 500 free minutes are **reset on the 1st of each month**. Free minutes are not available if you are using a Team. 

You cannot invite collaborators to an individual plan.

To start using Codemagic for free, [sign up here](https://codemagic.io/signup). 

### 2. Buying Additional Minutes

You can enable billing on personal accounts and pay for any additional minutes you want to use. You will still have **500 free build minutes** on macOS M2 VM. To enable billing, proceed [here](https://codemagic.io/billing). 

Postpaid minutes are billed on the first day of the following month in which they were used.

Usage on macOS M2 VM that exceeds 500 minutes is charged at the rate shown below.

Builds on Linux and Windows do not have free build minutes. The per-minute pricing for each instance type is shown below.

## Pricing for Teams

### 1. Pay-as-you-go

For teams, all build minutes using macOS M2 VM and Linux VM are charged at the rates shown below. 

Each extra build concurrency allows running an additional build in parallel. For example, adding two extra build concurrencies allows running a total of three builds in parallel. 

You can **add additional concurrencies** in the Codemagic web app by clicking 'Billing' in the left-hand menu and then clicking on your Team name. In the 'Billing Overview' you should click 'update' in the Build concurrency section and select the number of concurrencies you wish to add to your Team. 

Each additional concurrency is $49/month and you will be billed for each concurrency on the last day of each month.

## Build history and artifact storage

Build history and artifact retention time depend on your account type and pricing plan.

<br>

| **Account type**  |  **Retention period** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Personal accounts | Build history and artifacts of apps on the personal account are stored in Codemagic for **30 days** after which they are deleted. | 
| Teams on Pay as you go plan | Build history and artifacts of apps on the team account with Pay as you go pricing are stored in Codemagic for **60 days** after which they are deleted.| 
| Teams on Fixed Annual or Enterprise plan | Unlimited | 

### Backing up build artifacts

If you need to support older versions of your application and need access to old versions of your `ipa`, `apk`, `dSYM`, and proguard mapping files to debug issues, then these should be downloaded and stored outside Codemagic. Once they have been deleted from Codemagic, they cannot be retrieved.

You can download build artifacts via the Codemagic UI or using the [Codemagic REST API](../rest-api/builds/). 

To keep copies of your future build artifacts, we advise you to set up publishing to external storage, see an example [here](../yaml-publishing/aws/).

Codemagic provides macOS, Windows, and Linux instance types.
