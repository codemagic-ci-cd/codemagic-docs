## Build history and artifact storage

### Personal account storage

Build history and artifacts of apps on the personal account are stored in Codemagic for 30 days after which they are deleted. If you rely on build artifacts to support older versions of your app, we recommend that you back them up. For example, you can upload the artifacts to an [Amazon S3 bucket](/knowledge-base/publish-build-artifacts-to-amazon-s3).

### Team account storage

Builds and artifacts of apps that are part of a team in Codemagic do not expire and are available in Codemagic until the app is deleted.
