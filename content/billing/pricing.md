## Free plan

The free plan allows you to use 500 minutes per month on macOS M1 standard machines on a personal account. Your 500 free minutes will be reset on the 1st of each month. Free minutes are not available if you are using a Team.

To start using Codemagic for free, [sign up here](https://codemagic.io/signup). 
## Pay as you go pricing

Pay as you go pricing allows you to pay for only what you use. You will never be charged more than $299/month on Codemagic's pay as you go plan and can continue to build as much as you want using any of our available instance types.

Extra build concurrencies allow Teams to run up to three parallel builds.

## Build history and artifact storage

Build history and artifact retention time depends on your account type and pricing plan.

{{<notebox>}}
**Important**: We are changing our build history and artifact retention policy starting from August 1, 2022 and limiting the retention period for teams on the Pay as you go plan. See more details below.
{{</notebox>}}

<br>

| **Account type**  |  **Retention period** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Personal accounts | Build history and artifacts of apps on the personal account are stored in Codemagic for **30 days** after which they are deleted. | 
| Teams on Pay as you go plan | Build history and artifacts of apps on the team account with Pay as you go pricing are stored in Codemagic for **60 days** after which they are deleted. (Unlimited until August 1, 2022)| 
| Teams on Professional or Enterprise plan | Unlimited | 

### Backing up build artifacts

If you need to support older versions of your application and need access to old versions of your `ipa`, `apk`, `dSYM` and proguard mapping files to debug issues, then these should be downloaded and stored outside Codemagic. Once they have been deleted from Codemagic, they cannot be retrieved.

You can download build artifacts via the Codemagic UI or using the [Codemagic REST API](../rest-api/builds/). 

To keep copies of your future build artifacts, we advise you to set up publishing to an external storage, see an example [here](../yaml-publishing/aws/).
