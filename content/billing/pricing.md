## Pricing for Individuals
### 1. Free plan

This plan is suitable for individuals working on hobby or indie projects. You can also use this plan for running a proof of concept.

Individuals receive **500 free minutes** per month on macOS M2 machines on a personal account. These 500 free minutes are **reset on the 1st of each month**. Free minutes are not available if you are using a Team. 

You cannot invite collaborators to an individual plan.

To start using Codemagic for free, [sign up here](https://codemagic.io/signup). 

### 2. Buying Additional Minutes

You can enable billing on personal accounts and pay for any additional minutes you want to use. You will still have **500 free build minutes** on macOS M2 VM. To enable billing, proceed [here](https://codemagic.io/billing). 

Postpaid minutes are billed on the first day of the following month in which they were used.

Usage on macOS M2 VM that exceeds 500 minutes is charged at the rate shown below.

Builds on Linux and Windows do not have free build minutes. The per-minute pricing for each instance type is shown below.

| **Item**                     | **Price**                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------  |
| macOS (M2) VM        | $0.095 / minute                    |
| Linux X2 & Windows VMs          | $0.045 / minute                    |

## Pricing for Teams

### 1. Pay-as-you-go

For teams, all build minutes using macOS M2 VM and Linux VM are charged at the rates shown below. 

Each extra build concurrency allows running an additional build in parallel. For example, adding two extra build concurrencies allows running a total of three builds in parallel. 

You can **add additional concurrencies** in the Codemagic web app by clicking 'Billing' in the left-hand menu and then clicking on your Team name. In the 'Billing Overview' you should click 'update' in the Build concurrency section and select the number of concurrencies you wish to add to your Team. 

Each additional concurrency is $49/month and you will be billed for each concurrency on the last day of each month.


| **Item**                     | **Price**                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | 
| macOS (M2) VM        | $0.095 / minute                   |                                                                                                                                   
| Linux X2 & Windows VMs          | $0.045 / minute                   |                                                                       
| Extra build concurrency      | $49 / month                       | 

Consider an annual or Enterprise plan if more than three concurrent builds are required or if you would like unlimited build minutes on macOS (Apple Silicon M4), Linux, and Windows instances.

## Burstable concurrencies

Burstable concurrencies allow you to use more concurrencies than you otherwise would have available during peak times and pay **1/3** of the price for those concurrencies. If queue time is important for you, you can have a reserve of concurrencies available to use during high demand so you don‚Äôt build up a queue. Similarly if you‚Äôre making a big release that would otherwise take a long time you could use burstable concurrencies. 

{{<notebox>}}
üîî Burstable concurrencies are available starting from 10 concurrencies and you will get billed monthly using the 95th percentile method. 
{{</notebox>}}

To determine which concurrencies are bursted and which ones are not we divide billing period into 5 second intervals and sample concurrency usage every 5 seconds. We then reorder this graph in descending order so the left of the graph is consisting of high use of concurrency and tail end of the graph is low use of concurrency. We then discard 5% of the high use as ‚Äúbursting‚Äù and consider only the use at 95th percentile.

If you subscribe to 20 concurrencies and consume 10 within the 95th percentile, then you pay full price for 10 and **1/3** of the price for the remaining 20.

## Pricing for Enterprises

This plan is recommended if you need to go through a **security compliance process**, **vendor registration** or have special requirements such as an **NDA**, **DPA**, **dedicated hosts**, **custom base images**, or other account management services. Enterprise plan pricing starts from $12k/year.

## Resellers

It's possible to resell the Codemagic Enterprise plan. Contact us [here](https://codemagic.io/pricing/#enterprise) for further details. 

## Build history and artifact storage

Build history and artifact retention time depend on your account type and pricing plan.

<br>

| **Account type**  |  **Retention period** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Personal accounts | Build history and artifacts of apps on the personal account are stored in Codemagic for **30 days** after which they are deleted. | 
| Teams on Pay as you go plan | Build history and artifacts of apps on the team account with Pay as you go pricing are stored in Codemagic for **60 days** after which they are deleted.| 
| Teams on Fixed Annual or Enterprise plan | Unlimited | 

### Backing up build artifacts

If you need to support older versions of your application and need access to old versions of your `ipa`, `apk`, `dSYM`, and proguard mapping files to debug issues, then these should be downloaded and stored outside Codemagic. Once they have been deleted from Codemagic, they cannot be retrieved.

You can download build artifacts via the Codemagic UI or using the [Codemagic REST API](../rest-api/builds/). 

To keep copies of your future build artifacts, we advise you to set up publishing to external storage, see an example [here](../yaml-publishing/aws/).

### Instance Types

Codemagic provides macOS, Windows, and Linux instance types.
