**dSYM** files store the debug symbols for your app. It contains mapping information to decode a stack-trace into readable format. The purpose of **dSYM** is to replace symbols in the crash logs with the specific methods so it will be readable and helpful for debugging the crash. In order to generate debug symbols, Firebase Crashlytics must be installed using the following command line:

```
flutter pub add firebase_crashlytics
```

Alternatively, **firebase_crashlytics: ^2.5.2** could be added in **pubspec.yaml** file under **dependencies**:

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_crashlytics: ^2.5.2
```

As soon as your build finishes successfully, debug symbols are generated. However, if you want them to be displayed in the Codemagic UI on the build page, then the following path needs to be configured in codemagic.yaml under the artifacts section:

```
 - $HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/**/Build/**/*.dSYM
 ```

In order to upload the dSYM files to Firebase Crashlytics, add the following script to your codemagic.yaml configuration file or to your post-publish script in the Flutter workflow editor: 

  ```bash
  echo "Find build artifacts"
  dsymPath=$(find $CM_BUILD_DIR/build/ios/archive/Runner.xcarchive -name "*.dSYM" | head -1)
  if [[ -z ${dsymPath} ]]
  then
    echo "No debug symbols were found, skip publishing to Firebase Crashlytics"
  else
    echo "Publishing debug symbols from $dsymPath to Firebase Crashlytics"
    ls -d -- ios/Pods/*
    $CM_BUILD_DIR/ios/Pods/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist -p ios $dsymPath
  fi
  ```
 
The above-mentioned **dsymPath** is Flutter specific and it could change depending on what platform the app is built. 

With React Native or Native iOS applications:

```
dsymPath=$(find $CM_BUILD_DIR/build/ios/xcarchive/*.xcarchive -name "*.dSYM" | head -1)
```

In general, remote access to the build machine is a better practice to find a correct path. More information can be found [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/troubleshooting/accessing-builder-machine-via-ssh/)

For Native iOS apps, in the case of using SwiftPackageManager (SPM) instead of CocoaPods, the following script needs to be added in a post-publishing script:

```bash
echo "Find build artifacts"
dsymPath=$(find build/ios/xcarchive/* | head -1)
echo "dsyms expected in:"
ls -d -- $dsymPath/dSYMs/*
dsymFile=$(find $dsymPath/dSYMs -name "*.dSYM" | head -1) 
if [[ -z ${dsymFile} ]]
then
  echo "No debug symbols were found, skip publishing to Firebase Crashlytics"
else
  echo "Publishing debug symbols in $dsymFile to Firebase Crashlytics"
  echo $dsymFile
  ls -d -- $CM_BUILD_DIR/*
  $HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/**/SourcePackages/checkouts/firebase-ios-sdk/Crashlytics/upload-symbols -gsp $CM_BUILD_DIR/<PATH_TO_YOUR_GoogleService-Info.plist> -p ios $dsymFile
fi
```

## Sample Project

A sample project for uploading **dSYM** files to Firebase Crashlytics can be found [here](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/tree/main/integrations/firebase_crashlytics_demo_project)
