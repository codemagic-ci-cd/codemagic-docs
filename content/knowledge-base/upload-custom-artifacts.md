You can use a script to upload custom artifacts, such as screenshots, to `$FCI_EXPORT_DIR` and include them in the build artifacts ZIP file generated by Codemagic.

For example, in a [codemagic.yaml script](../getting-started/yaml/#scripts) step or Flutter workflow editor **post-test** script, use this command to copy build screenshots to `$FCI_EXPORT_DIR` to be exported:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

cp  -r build/screenshots $FCI_EXPORT_DIR/screenshots
```
