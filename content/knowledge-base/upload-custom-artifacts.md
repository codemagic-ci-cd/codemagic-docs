You can use a custom script to upload custom artifacts, such as screenshots, to `$FCI_EXPORT_DIR` and include them in the build artifacts ZIP file generated by Codemagic.

For example, add this **post-test** script to copy screenshots to `$FCI_EXPORT_DIR`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

cp  -r build/screenshots $FCI_EXPORT_DIR/screenshots
```
