Instead of committing the Firebase configuration files to your repository, you can upload them to Codemagic as [environment variables](../building/environment-variables/) and reference them in a custom script. Note that the Firebase configuration file (`google-services.json` for Android or `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS) must be Base64-encoded.

1.  Save your Firebase config files as environment variables, e.g. `ANDROID_FIREBASE_SECRET` and `IOS_FIREBASE_SECRET`. 
2.  Add the following **pre-build** script echoing your variables to load the Firebase configuration in Codemagic.

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  set -e # exit on first failed command

  echo $ANDROID_FIREBASE_SECRET | base64 --decode > $FCI_BUILD_DIR/android/app/google-services.json
  echo $IOS_FIREBASE_SECRET | base64 --decode > $FCI_BUILD_DIR/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
  ```

  In case your project is in a nested folder structure, it has to be reflected and the script should be as follows: 

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  set -e # exit on first failed command

  PROJECT_ROOT=$FCI_BUILD_DIR/myproject/path      # ADD YOUR PROJECT FOLDER PATH HERE

  echo $ANDROID_FIREBASE_SECRET | base64 --decode > $PROJECT_ROOT/android/app/google-services.json
  echo $IOS_FIREBASE_SECRET | base64 --decode > $PROJECT_ROOT/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
  ```

`post-clone script failed on base64 decode. The command could not be found`
If you received this error message when using the script above, it may be due to some invisible Unicode characters in the script after copy-pasting it. Try removing the space between the `base64` command and the `--decode` option and then adding it back.
