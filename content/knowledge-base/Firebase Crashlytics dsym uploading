Here is how you can upload Xcode debugging symbols file to Firebase Crashlytics

  ```bash
  echo "Find build artifacts"
  dsymPath=$(find ~/build.xcarchive -name "*.dSYM.zip" | head -1)
  if [[ -z ${dsymPath} ]]
  then
    echo "No debug symbols were found, skip publishing to Firebase Crashlytics"
  else
    echo "Publishing debug symbols from $dsymPath to Firebase Crashlytics"
    ls -d -- ios/Pods/*
    $FCI_BUILD_DIR/ios/Pods/Crashlytics/iOS/Crashlytics.framework/upload-symbols -gsp ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist -p ios $dsymPath
  fi
  ```

Add this script to either your configuration file or in your post-publish script in the Flutter workflow editor to locate and upload dsym files to Firebase Crashlytics.
