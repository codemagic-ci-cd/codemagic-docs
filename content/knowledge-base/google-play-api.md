In order to allow Codemagic publish applications to Google Play, it is necessary to set up access using Google Play API. 

## Setting up the service account on Google Play and Google Cloud Platform

1. In Google Play Console, navigate to **Settings > API access** and click **Create new service account**.<br><br>

3. In step 1, fill in the **Service account details** and click **Create**. The name of the service account will allow you to identify it among other service accounts you may have created.

4. In step 2, click the **Select a role** dropdown menu and choose **Project > Editor** as the role.<br><br>

11. On the **Account permissions** tab, leave everything as is (there is no need to grant the service account **Admin** access).<br><br>

12. Finally, click **Invite user** to finish setting up the service account on Google Play.

## Using the service account with codemagic.yaml

In order to set up publishing to Google Play, you need to encrypt the contents of the service account `JSON` key file and add the encrypted value to the Codemagic configuration file.

1. Navigate to your app settings in the Codemagic UI and click **Encrypt environment variables** at the bottom of the screen.<br><br>

2. Upload or drop the `JSON` key file to the encryption interface and copy the encrypted value.

3. In your configuration file, set the encrypted value to the `credentials` variable under `google_play` publishing and commit the changes.
```yaml
workflows:
    publish-workflow:
        name: Publish to Google Play
        ...
        publishing:
            google_play:
                credentials: Encrypted(...)
                track: alpha # specify the Google Play destination track
```


## Using the service account with Flutter UI projects

When configuring Flutter projects through the UI, the service account `JSON` key file must be uploaded to Codemagic in Google Play publishing settings. Follow the instructions [here](../publishing/publishing-to-google-play).
