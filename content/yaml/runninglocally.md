#### Running codemagic.yaml locally

This is probably where we want to bring in codemagic cli tools because if I understand correctly, this is how we can make the code signing part portable. Cli tools are available in our repo (open source). I assume that the user has to install them locally to use them. 

Could use some examples of using your code in other enivornments or locally (some templates, some additional information that I can edit and make pretty).

Basically - this is the kind of tools we have, this is where you find them, this is how you install them, this is what you can do with them( verifying locally etc.).
