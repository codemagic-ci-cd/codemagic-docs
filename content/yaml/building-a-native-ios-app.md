With `codemagic.yaml`, you can use Codemagic to build, test and publish native iOS apps. You can read more about how to use `codemagic.yaml` and see the structure of the file [here](../yaml/yaml).

{{<notebox>}}
Codemagic uses the [xcode-project](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/xcode-project/README.md#xcode-project) to prepare iOS application code signing properties for build.

## Building an unsigned native iOS app (.app)

For building an unsigned iOS app (.app), you need to run the following command in the scripts section:

    - |
      cd $FCI_BUILD_DIR
      xcodebuild build -workspace "MyXcodeWorkspace.xcworkspace" \
                       -scheme "MyScheme" \
                       CODE_SIGN_INDENTITY="" \
                       CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO \
                       CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO

## Building a native iOS app archive (.ipa)

For building an archived iOS app (.ipa), you need to run the following command in the scripts section:

    - xcode-project build-ipa --project "$FCI_BUILD_DIR/MyXcodeProject.xcodeproj" --scheme "MyScheme"

## Testing, code signing and publishing an iOS app

To test, code sign and publish an iOS app:

* The code for testing an iOS app also goes under `scripts`, before build commands. An example for testing an iOS app can be found [here](../yaml/testing/#native-ios).
* All iOS applications need to be signed before release. A full example of iOS code singing with YAML is available [here](../yaml/distribution).
* All generated artifacts can be published to external services. The available integrations currently are email, Slack and App Store Connect. It is also possible to publish elsewhere with custom scripts (e.g. Firebase App Distribution). Script examples for all of them are available [here](../yaml/distribution/#publishing).
