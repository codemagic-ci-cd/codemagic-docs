Test scripts are added under `scripts` in the [overall architecture](../yaml/yaml/#template), before the build commands.

## React Native unit test

This is a basic example with jest, given that jest tests are defined in the `package.json` file.

    npm test

## Native Android

For non-UI tests or unit testing:

    ./gradlew test

UI tests (also known as instrumental tests):

    ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

## Native iOS

    xcodebuild \
        -workspace MyAwesomeApp.xcworkspace \
        -scheme MyAwesomeApp \
        -sdk iphonesimulator \
        -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6,OS=8.1' \
        test | xcpretty

## Flutter test
    flutter test

## Flutter drive test

    flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator                  # for android use: flutter emulators --launch emulator
    flutter drive --target=test_driver/my_drive_target.dart
