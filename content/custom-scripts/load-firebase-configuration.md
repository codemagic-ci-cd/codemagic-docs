Instead of committing the Firebase config files to your repository, you can upload them to Codemagic as [environment variables](https://docs.codemagic.io/building/environment-variables/) and reference them in a custom script. Note that the Firebase config file (`google-services.json` for Android or `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS) must be Base64-encoded.

1.  Save your Firebase config files as environment variables, e.g. `ANDROID_FIREBASE_SECRET` and `IOS_FIREBASE_SECRET`. Make sure to check **Secure**.
2.  Add the following **pre-build** script echoing your variables to load the Firebase configuration in Codemagic.

        #!/usr/bin/env sh

        set -e # exit on first failed commandset

        echo $ANDROID_FIREBASE_SECRET | base64 --decode > $FCI_BUILD_DIR/android/app/google-services.json
        echo $IOS_FIREBASE_SECRET | base64 --decode > $FCI_BUILD_DIR/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

`post-clone script failed on base64 decode. The command could not be found`
If you received this error message when using the script above, it may be due to some invisible Unicode characters in the script after copy-pasting it. Try removing the space between the `base64` command and the `--decode` option and then adding it back.
