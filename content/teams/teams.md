If more than one developer is contributing to a project, it is wiser to set up a team so that everyone could work on the project together. Teams of two are free of charge. It is possible to invite more members by purchasing additional seats. Billing information is available [here](https://codemagic.io/pricing/).

{{<notebox>}}Note that teams who enabled billing before June, 2020, and have not yet migrated to the new billing, still operate under the previous billing system.{{</notebox>}}


## Creating a new team

To create a new team, go to the [teams page](https://codemagic.io/teams) and click **Create new team**. Choose a suitable name for your team, check the relevant boxes to add the app(s) your team is going to work on and then click **Create team**. If you don't have any apps to share at this point, you can just add them later.

## Team settings

On the team settings page, you can change your team's name, add or remove shared applications, add or remove users, change user roles, manage billing and paid features, leave the team or delete it.

### Changing the team name

To change the name of the team, click on its name field and change the name as you see fit. After you are done with the changes, click on the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the page. This can only be done by the team owner.

### Adding/Removing shared applications

To add or remove shared applications, click on **Shared applications** to see the list of available applications. Check the repositories you wish to share with your team and uncheck the ones you wish to remove. Once done, click **Save changes**. This can only be done by the team owner.

### Adding/Removing team members

You can add one additional user for free by clicking on **Invite team member**. If you need to add more users, enable billing (by clicking **Enable billing to add more members**) and you can add additional members to the team. This can only be done by the team owner.

To remove any team members, click on the three dots next to their name and then click **Remove user**.

### Enabling billing

There are two ways to enable billing. Either click on the **Enable billing** button or click **Enable billing to add more members** under **Team members**. Both options open a pop-up window where you can fill in your credit card information and click **Confirm and enable billing**.

After the billing is enabled, billing information (amount due, next payment date and billing history) will be visible on the right of the page. There, you can also click **Update billing information** to change the billing information.

### Disable billing

To disable billing, click on the **Disable billing** button in the **Danger zone**, right next to the **Delete team** button.

### Managing team integrations

By default, team creator's login data is used to access repository information. If you want to change it, click on **Team integrations** to open the full view of available integrations and connect the suitable ones by clicking **Connect**.

### Leaving the team

A team member can leave the team at any time by clicking **Leave team** in the lower part of the page. If the only team owner wants to leave the team, they first have to upgrade another member to the owner. Another option for leaving the team is to delete it completely.

### Deleting the team

Only the team owner can delete teams. To do so, go to the lower part of the page (under **Danger zone**) and click **Delete team**.

{{<notebox>}}Note that teams can only be deleted if they are empty (no members or shared applications) and the billing has been disabled.{{</notebox>}}
