**Sofy** is a testing automation platform that uses testing capabilities to enable tests without writing a single line of code. 

## Configuring Sofy App Automation with Codemagic

It is possible to publish binaries generated by **Codemagic** and schedule automation tests with **Sofy** via **codemagic.yaml**. More info can be found [here](../yaml/yaml-getting-started/). In order to achieve it, you need to sign up with [**Sofy**](https://sofy.ai/) where you will access your API Key which is a must to have for deploying your apps via **Codemagic**. 

## Real Time and App Automation

The following **cURL** commands will help you achieveing the deployment process:

**Uploading apps**

```
- name: Publish APK / AAB / IPA to Sofy
  script: |
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.sofy.ai/api/AppTests/buildUpload' \
    --header "SubscriptionKey: $SOFY_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY" \
    --form "applicationFile=@"$APK_PATH""
```

**Scheduling automation tests**

```
- name: Schedule an automation test with Sofy
  script: |
   curl --location --request POST 'https://api.sofy.ai/api/CICD/ScheduleAutomatedTestRun' 
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json'    
    --data-raw '{
    "APIKey":"$SOFY_API_KEY",
    "ScheduledID":$SCHEDULE_ID
    }'
```

**Checking status of scheduled tests**

```
- name: Schedule an automation test with Sofy
  script: |
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.sofy.ai/api/CICD/ScheduleAutomatedTestRunStatus'    
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json'     
    --data-raw '{
        "APIKey":"$SOFY_API_KEY",
        "ScheduledID":$SCHEDULE_ID
    }'
```

**$SOFY_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY**, **ScheduledID** and **$SOFY_API_KEY** are coming from your **Sofy** account settings and can be named to anything preferred. More info can be found [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/variables/environment-variable-groups/) about how to set up environment variable groups with Codemagic. Environment variables can be added in the Codemagic web app using the ‘Environment variables’ tab. You can then and import your variable groups into your codemagic.yaml. For example, if you named your variable group ‘browserstack_credentials’, you would import it as follows:

```
workflows:
  workflow-name:
    environment:
      groups:
        - sofy_credentials

```

As soon as your **.ipa** and **.apk** are successfully built, they will appear in the **Sofy UI** any preferred devices can be selected for testing with **Real Time**. If devices need to be pre-chosen, then some capabilities provided by **Sofy** device settings must be injected into your project's test scripts. 

## Sample project

A sample project that shows how to configure Sofy integration is available [here]().
