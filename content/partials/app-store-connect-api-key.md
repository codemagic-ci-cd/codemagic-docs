It is recommended to create a dedicated App Store Connect API key for Codemagic in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api). To do so:

1. Log in to App Store Connect and navigate to **Users and Access > Integrations >> App Store Connect API**.
2. Click on the + sign to generate a new API key.
3. Enter the name for the key and select an access level. We recommend choosing `App Manager` access rights, read more about Apple Developer Program role permissions [here](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deve5f9a89d7).
4. Click **Generate**.
5. As soon as the key is generated, you can see it added to the list of active keys. Click **Download API Key** to save the private key for later. Note that the key can only be downloaded once.

Take note of the **Issuer ID** above the table of active keys as well as the **Key ID** of the generated key as these will be required when setting up the Apple Developer Portal integration in the Codemagic UI.
