#### Configuring environment variables

Provisioning profiles and code signing certificates are obtained from Apple Developer portal with the command [`app-store-connect fetch-signing-files`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/app-store-connect/fetch-signing-files.md#fetch-signing-files). App Store Connect API key information can be passed to it via environment variables [`APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/app-store-connect/fetch-signing-files.md#--key-idkey_identifier), [`APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/app-store-connect/fetch-signing-files.md#--issuer-idissuer_id), [`APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/app-store-connect/fetch-signing-files.md#--private-keyprivate_key).

Integration will take care of the App Store Connect API authentication part, but additionally the certificate private key has to be exported too. For this additional environment variable [`CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/app-store-connect/fetch-signing-files.md#--certificate-keyprivate_key) has to be defined.

1. Open your Codemagic app settings, and go to the **Environment variables** tab.
2. Enter `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY` as the **_Variable name_**.
3. Open the file `ios_distribution_private_key` with a text editor and copy the **entire contents** of the file, including the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` tags. Alternatively, you can run the following command on the file:

{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
cat ios_distribution_private_key | pbcopy
{{< /highlight >}}

4. Paste into the **_Variable value_** field.
5. Enter a variable group name, e.g. **_code-signing_**. Click the button to create the group.
6. Make sure the **Secure** option is selected so that the variable can be protected by encryption.
7. Click the **Add** button to add the variable.

In your workflow you can now simply use the following to ensure that all variables are readily available during build:

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  ios-workflow:
    environment:
        groups:
            - code-signing
    integrations:
        app_store_connect: <App Store Connect API key name>
{{< /highlight >}}

This will expose necessary environment variables during the build.

1. Open your Codemagic app settings, and go to the **Environment variables** tab.
2. Enter `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY` as the **_Variable name_**.
3. Open the file `ios_distribution_private_key` with a text editor and copy the **entire contents** of the file, including the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` tags. Alternatively, you can run the following command on the file:

{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
cat ios_distribution_private_key | pbcopy
{{< /highlight >}}

4. Paste into the **_Variable value_** field.
5. Enter a variable group name, e.g. **_appstore_credentials_**. Click the button to create the group.
6. Make sure the **Secure** option is selected so that the variable can be protected by encryption.
7. Click the **Add** button to add the variable.

8. Run the following command on the **App Store Connect API key** file that you downloaded earlier (in our example saved as `codemagic_api_key.p8`) to copy its content to clipboard:
{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
cat codemagic_api_key.p8 | pbcopy
{{< /highlight >}}

9. Create a new Environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY` and paste the value from clipboard.

---

10. Create variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER`. The value is the **Key ID** field from **App Store Connect > Users and Access > Keys**.
11. Create variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`. The value is the **Issuer ID** field from **App Store Connect > Users and Access > Keys**.

**Tip**: Store all the of these variables in the same group so they can be imported to codemagic.yaml workflow at once.

Environment variables have to be added to the workflow either individually or as a group. Modify your `codemagic.yaml` file by adding the following:
{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  ios-workflow:
    name: iOS Workflow
    # ....
    environment:
        groups:
            - appstore_credentials
