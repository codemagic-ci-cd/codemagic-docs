Codemagic enables you to automatically publish your iOS or macOS app to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) for beta testing with [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) or distributing the app to users via App Store. Codemagic uses the **App Store Connect API key** for authenticating communication with Apple's services. You can read more about generating an API key from Apple's [documentation page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating_api_keys_for_app_store_connect_api).

Please note that:

1. for App Store Connect publishing, the provided key needs to have [App Manager permission](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deve5f9a89d7),
2. and in order to submit your iOS application to App Store Connect, it must be code signed with a distribution [certificate](https://developer.apple.com/support/certificates/).

The following snippet demonstrates how to authenticate with and upload the IPA to App Store Connect, submit the build to beta tester groups in TestFlight and configure releasing the app to App Store. See additional configuration options for App Store Connect publishing [here](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/app-store-connect/publish.md).

{{<notebox>}}**Note:** Please note that you will need to create an **app record** in App Store Connect before you can automate publishing with Codemagic. It is recommended to upload the very first version of the app manually. Suppose you have set up an **app record** but have not manually uploaded the app's first version. In that case, manual configuration of the settings must be done on App Store Connect after the build is complete, such as uploading the required screenshots and providing the values for the privacy policy URL and application category. {{</notebox>}}
