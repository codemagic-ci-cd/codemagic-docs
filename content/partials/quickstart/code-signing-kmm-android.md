#### Generating a keystore
You can create a keystore for signing your release builds with the Java Keytool utility by running the following command:

{{< highlight Shell "style=paraiso-dark">}}
keytool -genkey -v -keystore codemagic.keystore -storetype JKS \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias codemagic
{{< /highlight >}}

Keytool then prompts you to enter your personal details for creating the certificate, as well as provide passwords for the keystore and the key. It then generates the keystore as a file called **codemagic.keystore** in the directory you're in. The key is valid for 10,000 days.

#### Uploading a keystore

1. Open your Codemagic Team settings, and go to  **codemagic.yaml settings** > **Code signing identities**.
2. Open **Android keystores** tab.
3. Upload the keystore file by clicking on **Choose a file** or by dragging it into the indicated frame.
4. Enter the **Keystore password**, **Key alias** and **Key password** values as indicated.
5. Enter the keystore **Reference name**. This is a unique name used to reference the file in `codemagic.yaml`
6. Click the **Add keystore** button to add the keystore.

For each of the added keystore, its common name, issuer, and expiration date are displayed.

**Note**: The uploaded keystore cannot be downloaded from Codemagic. It is crucial that you independently store a copy of the keystore file as all subsequent builds released to Google Play should be signed with the same keystore.

However, keep the keystore file private and do not check it into a public repository.

#### Referencing keystores in codemagic.yaml

To tell Codemagic to fetch the uploaded keystores from the **Code signing identities** section during the build, list the reference of the uploaded keystore under the `android_signing` field.

Add the following code to the `environment` section of your `codemagic.yaml` file:

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  android-workflow:
    name: Android Workflow
    # ....
    environment:
      android_signing:
        - keystore_reference
{{< /highlight >}}

Default environment variables are assigned by Codemagic for the values on the build machine:

- Keystore path: `CM_KEYSTORE_PATH`
- Keystore password: `CM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- Key alias: `CM_KEY_ALIAS`
- Key alias password: `CM_KEY_PASSWORD`


#### Signing Android apps using Gradle

To sign your Android app, simply modify your **`androidApp/build.gradle.kts`** as follows:
{{< highlight Groovy "style=paraiso-dark">}}
...
  android {
      ...
      defaultConfig { ... }
      signingConfigs {
         create("release") {
                storeFile = file(System.getenv()["CM_KEYSTORE_PATH"])
                storePassword = System.getenv()["CM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"]
                keyAlias = System.getenv()["CM_KEY_ALIAS"]
                keyPassword = System.getenv()["CM_KEY_PASSWORD"]
          }
      }
      buildTypes {
          release {
              ...
              signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
          }
      }
  }
  ...
