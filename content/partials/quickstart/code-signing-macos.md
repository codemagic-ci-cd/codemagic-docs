#### Creating the App Store Connect API key
Signing macOS applications requires [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) membership.

### Automatic vs Manual code signing

Signing macOS apps requires a `Signing certificate` (App Store **development** or **distribution** certificate in `.p12` format) and a `Provisioning profile`. In **Manual code signing** you save these files as Codemagic `Environment variables` and manually reference them in the appropriate build steps.

In **Automatic code signing**, Codemagic takes care of Certificate and Provisioning profile management for you. Based on the `certificate private key` that you provide, Codemagic will automatically fetch the correct certificate from the App Store or create a new one if necessary.

#### Certificate types
There are several certificate types you can choose to sign your macOS app, depending on the distribution method you plan to use.

- `MAC_APP_DEVELOPMENT` certificate allows you to build your app for internal testing and debugging.
- `MAC_APP_DISTRIBUTION` certificate is used to sign a Mac app before submitting it to the Mac App Store
- `MAC_INSTALLER_DISTRIBUTION` is used to sign and submit a Mac Installer Package to the Mac App Store
- `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION` is used to sign a Mac app before distributing it outside the Mac App Store
- `DEVELOPER_ID_INSTALLER` is used to sign a Mac Installer Package before distributing it outside the Mac App Store

For example, in order to publish to Mac App Store, the application must be signed with a `Mac App Distribution` certificate using a `Mac App Store` provisioning profile. If you want to create a `.pkg` Installer package, you must use a `Mac Installer Distribution` certificate.
#### Obtaining the certificate private key

To enable Codemagic to automatically fetch or create the correct signing certificate on your behalf, you need to provide the corresponding `certificate private key`. You then have to save that key as a Codemagic environment variable.

{{<markdown>}}
You can create a new 2048 bit RSA key by running the command below in your terminal:

{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f ~/Desktop/mac_distribution_private_key -q -N ""
{{< /highlight >}}

This new private key will be used to create a new Mac App Distribution certificate in your Apple Developer Program account if there isn't one that already matches this private key.
{{</markdown>}}

{{<markdown>}}

1. On the Mac which created the `Mac App Distribution` certificate, open the **Keychain Access**, located in the **Applications and Utilities** folder.
2. Select the appropriate certificate entry.
3. Right-click on it to select "Export."
4. In the export prompt window that appears, make sure the file format is set to **Personal Information Exchange (.p12)**"**.
5. Give the file a name such as "MAC_DISTRIBUTION", choose a location and click **Save**.
6. On the next prompt, leave the password empty and click **OK**.
7. Use the following `openssl` command to export the private key:

{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
openssl pkcs12 -in MAC_DISTRIBUTION.p12 -nodes -nocerts | openssl rsa -out mac_distribution_private_key
{{< /highlight >}}

8. When prompted for the import password, just press enter. The private key will be written to a file called **mac_distribution_private_key** in the directory where you ran the command.

#### Configuring environment variables
1. Open your Codemagic app settings, and go to the **Environment variables** tab.
2. Enter `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY` as the **_Variable name_**.
3. Open the file `mac_distribution_private_key` with a text editor and copy the **entire contents** of the file, including the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` tags. Alternatively, you can run the following command on the file:
{{< highlight bash "style=rrt">}}
  cat mac_distribution_private_key | pbcopy
{{< /highlight >}}
4. Paste into the **_Variable value_** field.
5. Enter a variable group name, e.g. **_appstore_credentials_**. Click the button to create the group.
6. Make sure the **Secure** option is selected so that the variable can be protected by encryption.
7. Click the **Add** button to add the variable.
8. Run the following command on the **App Store Connect API key** file that you downloaded earlier (in our example saved as `codemagic_api_key.p8`) to copy its content to clipboard:
{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
cat codemagic_api_key.p8 | pbcopy
{{< /highlight >}}

9. Create a new Environment variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY` and paste the value from clipboard.
10. Create variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER`. The value is the **Key ID** field from **App Store Connect > Users and Access > Keys**.
11. Create variable `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`. The value is the **Issuer ID** field from **App Store Connect > Users and Access > Keys**.

{{<notebox>}}
**Tip**: Store all the of these variables in the same group so they can be imported to codemagic.yaml workflow at once. 
{{</notebox>}}

Environment variables have to be added to the workflow either individually or as a group. Modify your `codemagic.yaml` file by adding the following:
{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
workflows:
  macos-workflow:
    name: macOS Workflow
    environment:
      groups:
        - appstore_credentials
{{< /highlight >}}

#### Automatic code signing
To code sign the app, add the following commands in the [`scripts`](../getting-started/yaml#scripts) section of the configuration file, after all the dependencies are installed, right before the build commands. 


{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
    scripts:
      - name: Set up keychain to be used for code signing using Codemagic CLI 'keychain' command
        script: keychain initialize
      - name: Fetch signing files
        script: | 
          app-store-connect fetch-signing-files "$BUNDLE_ID" \
            --platform MAC_OS \
            --type MAC_APP_STORE \
            --create
      - name: Fetch Mac Installer Distribution certificates
        script: |  
            app-store-connect certificates list --type MAC_APP_DISTRIBUTION --save || \
            app-store-connect certificates create --type MAC_APP_DISTRIBUTION --save
      - name: Set up signing certificate
        script: keychain add-certificates
      - name: Set up code signing settings on Xcode project
        script: xcode-project use-profiles
{{< /highlight >}}

Instead of specifying the exact bundle ID, you can use `"$(xcode-project detect-bundle-id)"`.

Based on the specified bundle ID and [provisioning profile type](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/app-store-connect/fetch-signing-files.md#--typeios_app_adhoc--ios_app_development--ios_app_inhouse--ios_app_store--mac_app_development--mac_app_direct--mac_app_store--mac_catalyst_app_development--mac_catalyst_app_direct--mac_catalyst_app_store--tvos_app_adhoc--tvos_app_development--tvos_app_inhouse--tvos_app_store), Codemagic will fetch or create the relevant provisioning profile and certificate to code sign the build.

### Creating the Installer package

To package your application into an `.pkg` Installer package and sign it with the `Mac Installer Distribution` certificate, use the following script:

{{< highlight yaml "style=paraiso-dark">}}
  scripts:
    - name: Package application
      script: | 
      set -x
    
      # Command to find the path to your generated app, may be different
      APP_NAME=$(find $(pwd) -name "*.app")  
      cd $(dirname "$APP_NAME")
    
      PACKAGE_NAME=$(basename "$APP_NAME" .app).pkg
      xcrun productbuild --component "$APP_NAME" /Applications/ unsigned.pkg  # Create and unsigned package

      # Find the installer certificate common name in keychain
      INSTALLER_CERT_NAME=$(keychain list-certificates \
        | jq '.[]
        | select(.common_name
        | contains("Mac Developer Installer"))
        | .common_name' \
        | xargs)
      
      xcrun productsign --sign "$INSTALLER_CERT_NAME" unsigned.pkg "$PACKAGE_NAME" # Sign the package
    
      rm -f unsigned.pkg                                                       # Optionally remove the not needed unsigned package
{{< /highlight >}}

{{<notebox>}}
**Note**: Don't forget to specify the path to your generated package in the [artifacts section](../getting-started/yaml/#artifacts).
{{</notebox>}}

### Notarizing macOS applications

Notarization is a process where Apple verifies your application to make sure it has a Developer ID code signature and does not contain malicious content. All apps distributed outside the Mac App Store have to be notarized.

Notarizing an app during the Codemagic build process is possible using the **altool** command as follows:

{{< highlight bash "style=paraiso-dark">}}
xcrun altool --notarize-app -f <file> --primary-bundle-id <bundle_id>
           {-u <username> [-p <password>] | --apiKey <api_key> --apiIssuer <issuer_id>}
           [--asc-provider <name> | --team-id <id> | --asc-public-id <id>]
