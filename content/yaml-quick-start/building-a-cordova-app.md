## Setting up a Cordova project

The apps you have available on Codemagic are listed on the Applications page. Click **Add application** to add a new app.

1. On the [Applications page](https://codemagic.io/apps), click **Set up build** next to the app you want to start building. 
2. On the popup, select **Cordova** as the project type and click **Continue**.
3. Create a [`codemagic.yaml`](./yaml) file and add in it the commands to build, test and publish your project. See the full workflow examples below.
4. Commit the configuration file to the root of your repository.
5. Back in app settings in Codemagic, scan for the `codemagic.yaml` file by selecting a **branch** to scan and clicking the **Check for configuration file** button at the top of the page. Note that you can have different configuration files in different branches.
6. If a `codemagic.yaml` file is found in that branch, you can click **Start your first build** and select the **branch** and **workflow** to build.
7. Finally, click **Start new build** to build the app.

**Automatic build triggers**

Note that you need to set up a [webhook](../building/webhooks) for automatic build triggers. Click the **Create webhook** button on the right sidebar in app settings to add a webhook (not available for apps added via SSH/HTTP/HTTPS).

## Code signing and publishing Cordova Android and iOS apps

To build, code sign, and publish Cordova Android and iOS apps:

* All Android apps need to be signed before release. See the [Android code signing docs](../code-signing/android-code-signing/) or the sample workflow below for more details.
* All iOS apps need to be signed before release. See the [iOS code signing docs](../code-signing/ios-code-signing/) or the sample workflow below for more details.
* All generated artifacts can be published to external services, such as email, Slack, and Google Play. The list of available integrations and script examples can be found under the [Publishing section](../publishing-yaml/distribution/).


## Cordova iOS workflow example

{{<notebox>}}
You can find an up-to-date codemagic.yaml Cordova iOS workflow in [Codemagic Sample Projects](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/blob/main/cordova/cordova-demo-project/codemagic.yaml#L2).

The following example workflow shows how to build your **Cordova** iOS app and publish it to App Store Connect.

Codemagic uses the [xcode-project](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/xcode-project/README.md#xcode-project) CLI command to prepare iOS application code signing properties for the build.
