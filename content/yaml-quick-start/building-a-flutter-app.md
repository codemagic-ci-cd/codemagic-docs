## Setting up a Flutter project

The apps you have available in Codemagic are listed on the Applications page. Click **Add application** to add a new app.

1. On the Applications page, click **Set up build** next to the app you want to start building.
2. On the popup, select **Flutter App** as the project type and click **Continue**.
3. Then you can choose to either set up your builds in the **codemagic.yaml** file or select the **Workflow Editor** tab to configure the builds in the UI. New Flutter apps come with the **Workflow Editor** by default and it can be switched to **codemagic.yaml** in app settings by clicking the **Switch to YAML configuration** button. Exporting current configuration as **codemagic.yaml** is possible if the checkbox is marked in the pop-up page.

`codemagic.yaml` is a highly customizable configuration file that you can use to build, test and publish Flutter apps, widgets, and Flutter or Dart packages. The Workflow Editor is a quick way to get started building standard Flutter applications.

You can simultaneously set up workflows both in `codemagic.yaml` and the Workflow Editor. However, when a `codemagic.yaml` is detected in the repository, it is automatically used for configuring builds that are triggered in response to the events defined in the file and any configuration in the Flutter workflow editor is ignored.

{{<notebox>}}
For documentation on building Flutter projects using the workflow editor, please refer to [**Building Flutter apps via the workflow editor**](../flutter-configuration/flutter-projects).
{{</notebox>}}

## Building with YAML

1. In order to use `codemagic.yaml` for build configuration in Codemagic, commit the file to the root directory of your repository.
2. Back in app settings in Codemagic, select the **`codemagic.yaml`** tab.
3. Scan for the `codemagic.yaml` file by selecting a **branch** to scan and clicking the **Check for configuration file** button at the top of the page. Note that you can have different configuration files in different branches.
4. If a `codemagic.yaml` file is found in that branch, you can click **Start your first build** and select the **branch** and **workflow** to build.
5. Finally, click **Start new build** to build the app.

## Android builds

{{<notebox>}}
You can find an up-to-date codemagic.yaml Flutter Android workflow in [Codemagic Sample Projects](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/blob/main/flutter/flutter-android-and-ios-yaml-demo-project/codemagic.yaml#L2).
{{</notebox>}}

Set up local properties

```yaml
- echo "flutter.sdk=$HOME/programs/flutter" > "$CM_BUILD_DIR/android/local.properties"
```

### Building an app bundle

```yaml
- flutter build appbundle --release
```

### Building .apk for debug builds

```yaml
- flutter build apk --debug
```

### Building universal .apk(s) from existing app bundle(s) with user-specified keys

If your app settings in Codemagic have building Android App Bundles enabled, we will automatically include a script for generating a signed `app-universal.apk` during the YAML export. If you are creating a YAML file from a scratch, add the following script to receive the .apk file(s):

```yaml
- android-app-bundle build-universal-apk \
  --bundle 'project_directory/build/**/outputs/**/*.aab' \
  --ks /tmp/keystore.keystore \
  --ks-pass $CM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
  --ks-key-alias $CM_KEY_ALIAS \
  --key-pass $CM_KEY_PASSWORD
```

Please make sure to wrap the `--bundle` pattern in single quotes. If the `--bundle` option is not specified, default glob pattern `**/*.aab` will be used.

More information about Android code signing can be found [here](../code-signing-yaml/signing-android).

{{<notebox>}}
Codemagic uses the [android-app-bundle](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/tree/master/docs/android-app-bundle#android-app-bundle) utility to build universal .apk files from Android App Bundles.

## iOS builds

{{<notebox>}}
You can find an up-to-date codemagic.yaml Flutter iOS workflow in [Codemagic Sample Projects](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/blob/main/flutter/flutter-android-and-ios-yaml-demo-project/codemagic.yaml#L72).
{{</notebox>}}

### Building an unsigned application .app

```yaml
- flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign
```

### Building a signed iOS application archive .ipa

{{<notebox>}}
Codemagic uses the [xcode-project](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/xcode-project/README.md#xcode-project) to prepare iOS application code signing properties for build.
{{</notebox>}}

```yaml
- xcode-project use-profiles
- xcode-project build-ipa --workspace ios/Runner.xcworkspace --scheme Runner
```

Read more about the different schemes in [Apple's documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev0bee46f46).

**Note:** If you are using Flutter version 1.24.0-6.0 or higher, the recommended command for building an .ipa archive is `flutter build ipa` as shown below. Read more about it in [Flutter's documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/ios#create-a-build-archive).

```yaml
- xcode-project use-profiles
- flutter build ipa --export-options-plist=/Users/builder/export_options.plist
```

  script: |
    flutter config --enable-web
    flutter build web --release
    cd build/web
    7z a -r ../web.zip ./*
```

## Windows desktop builds

### Building an unpackaged Windows executable

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: Build windows
    script: |
      flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
      flutter build windows --release
      cd build/windows/runner/Release
      7z a -r ../release.zip ./*
artifacts:
  - build/windows/runner/*.zip
```

### Creating an MSIX package for publishing to Microsoft Store

Codemagic uses the [Flutter msix package](https://pub.dev/packages/msix) for packaging the application. For publishing to the Microsoft Store, it is necessary to define certain arguments during packaging.

To pass these arguments to the packaging tool, either add the parameters to the packaging command in `codemagic.yaml` or add the package to your project and [configure](https://pub.dev/packages/msix#gear-configuration-optional) the arguments inside the `pubspec.yaml` file.

When defining the arguments inside codemagic.yaml, the necessary flags to add to the `msix:create` command are `--store`, `--display-name`, `--publisher-display-name`, `--publisher` and `--version`.

The values for `--display-name`, `--publisher-display-name` and `--publisher` can be found when when logging into [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/home) and navigating to **Apps and games > Your application > Product Identity**.

The argument `--display-name` should be set to match the value of `Package/Identity/Name`, the argument `--publisher` should be set to match the value of `Package/Identity/Publisher` and the argument `--publisher-display-name` should be set to match the value of `Package/Properties/PublisherDisplayName`.

Check out how to version your package in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/package-version-numbering). Note that per Microsoft Store requirements applications are not allowed to have a version with a revision number (last digit of the version) other than zero.

```yaml
scripts:
  - name: Build windows
    script: |
      ...
  - name: Package windows
    script: |
      flutter pub add msix  # this command is reduntant if you have got the msix pub package added to your project already
      flutter pub run msix:create --store --publisher-display-name=MyName --display-name=MyAppName --publisher=CN=xx-yy-zz --identity-name=com.flutter.MyApp --version=1.0.2.0
artifacts:
  - build/windows/**/*.msix
```

For all the possible flags for the `msix:create` command, check the [pub documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/msix#clipboard-available-configuration-fields). Note that when configuring the flags both in `codemagic.yaml` and `pubspec.yaml`, the ones configured in `codemagic.yaml` take precedence.

## Testing, code signing and publishing a Flutter app

To test, code sign and publish a Flutter app:

- Testing examples for a flutter app can be found [here](../testing-yaml/testing/#flutter-test).
- All iOS and Android applications need to be [signed](/code-signing-yaml/signing) before release. Different script examples are available under the Publishing section.
- All generated artifacts can be published to external services. Script examples for different options are available under the [Publishing section](../publishing-yaml/distribution/).
