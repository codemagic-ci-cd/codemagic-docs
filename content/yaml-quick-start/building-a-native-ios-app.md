## Setting up an iOS project

The apps you have available on Codemagic are listed on the Applications page. Click **Add application** to add a new app.

1. On the Applications page, click **Set up build** next to the app you want to start building. 
2. On the popup, select **iOS App** as the project type and click **Continue**.
3. Create a [`codemagic.yaml`](./yaml) file and add in it the commands to build, test and publish your project. See the full iOS workflow example [below](#ios-workflow-example).
4. Commit the configuration file to the root of your repository.
5. Back in app settings in Codemagic, scan for the `codemagic.yaml` file by selecting a **branch** to scan and clicking the **Check for configuration file** button at the top of the page. Note that you can have different configuration files in different branches.
6. If a `codemagic.yaml` file is found in that branch, you can click **Start your first build** and select the **branch** and **workflow** to build.
7. Finally, click **Start new build** to build the app.

**Tip**

Note that you need to set up a [webhook](../building/webhooks) for automatic build triggering. Click the **Create webhook** button on the right sidebar in app settings to add a webhook (not available for apps added via SSH/HTTP/HTTPS).

## Building an unsigned native iOS app (.app)

For building an unsigned iOS app (.app), you need to run the following command in the scripts section:

```yaml
- xcodebuild build -workspace "MyXcodeWorkspace.xcworkspace" -scheme "MyScheme" CODE_SIGN_INDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

If you don't have a workspace, use `-project "MyXcodeProject.xcodeproj"` instead of the `-workspace "MyXcodeWorkspace.xcworkspace"` option.

Your artifact will be generated at the default Xcode path. You can access it by adding the following pattern in the `artifacts` section of `codemagic.yaml`:

```yaml
$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/**/Build/**/*.app
```
If you have Xcode Debugging Symbols enabled, the dSYM file will be generated in the same directory as the app and can be accessed with the following artifact pattern:

```yaml
$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/**/Build/**/*.dSYM
```

## Building a native iOS app archive (.ipa)

{{<notebox>}}
Codemagic uses the [xcode-project](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/xcode-project/README.md#xcode-project) to prepare iOS application code signing properties for build.
{{</notebox>}}

For building an archived iOS app (.ipa) from your Xcode project, you need to run the following command in the scripts section:

```yaml
- xcode-project build-ipa --project "MyXcodeProject.xcodeproj" --scheme "MyScheme"
```

You can also build an archive from your Xcode workspace:

```yaml
- xcode-project build-ipa --workspace "MyXcodeWorkspace.xcworkspace" --scheme "MyScheme"
```

Please check [Codemagic CLI tools documentation](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/xcode-project/build-ipa.md#build-ipa) to learn about more optional arguments to `xcode-project build-ipa`.

By default, your artifacts will be generated into `build/ios/ipa` but you can specify a different location using the [`--ipa-directory`](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/blob/master/docs/xcode-project/build-ipa.md#--ipa-directoryipa_directory) option. The Xcode build log can be made available with the `/tmp/xcodebuild_logs/*.log` pattern and the dSYM file will be still available at the default Xcode path.

```yaml
artifacts:
  - build/ios/ipa/*.ipa
  - /tmp/xcodebuild_logs/*.log
  - $HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/**/Build/**/*.dSYM
```

## Testing, code signing and publishing an iOS app

To test, code sign and publish an iOS app:

* The code for testing an iOS app also goes under `scripts`, before build commands. An example for testing an iOS app can be found [here](../testing-yaml/testing/#native-ios).
* All iOS applications need to be signed before release. A full example of iOS code singing with YAML is available [here](../code-signing-yaml/signing-ios).
* All generated artifacts can be published to external services. The available integrations currently are email, Slack and App Store Connect. It is also possible to publish elsewhere with custom scripts (e.g. Firebase App Distribution). Script examples for all of them are available [here](../publishing-yaml/distribution/#publishing).

## iOS workflow example

{{<notebox>}}
You can find an up-to-date codemagic.yaml iOS workflow in Codemagic Sample Projects for [automatic code signing](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/blob/main/ios/ios-automatic-code-signing-demo-project/codemagic.yaml) and [manual code signing](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/blob/main/ios/ios-manual-code-signing-demo-project/codemagic.yaml).

The following example shows a workflow that can be used to publish your iOS app to App Store Connect.

```yaml
