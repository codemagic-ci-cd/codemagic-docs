This guide will illustrate all of the necessary steps to successfully build and publish a native iOS app with Codemagic. It will cover the basic steps such as build versioning, code signing and publishing.

You can find a complete project showcasing these steps in our [Sample projects repository](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-sample-projects/tree/main/ios/ios-native-quick-start).


## Adding the app to Codemagic
{{< include "/partials/quickstart/add-app-to-codemagic.md" >}}
## Creating codemagic.yaml
{{< include "/partials/quickstart/create-yaml-intro.md" >}}

## Code signing

All applications have to be digitally signed before they are made available to the public to confirm their author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed.

{{< include "/partials/quickstart/code-signing-ios.md" >}}

## Configure scripts to build the app
Add the following scripts to your `codemagic.yaml` file in order to prepare the build environment and start the actual build process.
In this step you can also define the build artifacts you are interested in. These files will be available for download when the build finishes. For more information about artifacts, see [here](../yaml/yaml-getting-started/#artifacts).

**Note**: If you don't have a workspace, use `--project "MyXcodeProject.xcodeproj"` instead of the `--workspace "MyXcodeWorkspace.xcworkspace"` option.

## Build versioning

If you are going to publish your app to App Store, each uploaded artifact must have a new version. Codemagic allows you to easily automate this process and increment the version numbers for each build. For more information and details, see [here](../configuration/build-versioning).

{{< include "/partials/quickstart/build-versioning-ios.md" >}}

## Publishing

Codemagic offers a wide array of options for app publishing and the list of partners and integrations is continuously growing. For the most up-to-date information, check the guides in the **Configuration > Publishing** section of these docs.
To get more details on the publishing options presented in this guide, please check the [Email publishing](../yaml-publishing/email) and the [App Store Connect](../yaml-publishing/app-store-connect) publishing docs.

## Conclusion
Having followed all of the above steps, you now have a working `codemagic.yaml` file that allows you to build, code sign, automatically version and publish your project using Codemagic CI/CD.
Save your work, commit the changes to the repository, open the app in the Codemagic UI and start the build to see it in action.


Your final `codemagic.yaml` file should look something like this:
