### MS Teams

To be able to receive an email from Codemagic to your MS Teams account, please make sure to set `Anyone can send emails to this address` in `Get email address` -> `advanced settings`.

From the whole address like `My awesome company <543l5kj43.some.address@somedomain.teams.ms>` use only the part in angle brackets.
