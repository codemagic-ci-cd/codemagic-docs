To simplify the build versioning of your Firebase App Distribution releases, you can fetch the latest release version of your Android or iOS build from Firebase App Distribution using the `firebase-app-distribution get-latest-build-version` action in [Codemagic CLI tools](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/tree/master/docs/firebase-app-distribution). See the [docs](https://docs.codemagic.io/knowledge-codemagic/build-versioning/#firebase-app-distribution-latest-build-version) for more information about using the CLI tools action for build versioning in Codemagic.

We will point `latest` and `edge` to this version on **April 19, 2023**.

Please note that Xcode 14.3 requires macOS 13.0+ and is therefore not compatible with macOS Intel-based build machines. We advise you to review your build configuration to avoid build failures. More information is available in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/codemagic-ci-cd/discussions/1545).

See the [build machine specs](https://docs.codemagic.io/specs/versions-macos/) for information about the preinstalled software and available runtimes.

Scheduled builds are now available also for personal teams so that everyone can build the habit of running builds at regular intervals.
Read more about how to schedule builds in our [docs](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-running-builds/scheduling/).

## Cancel previous TestFlight or App Store review submissions
<div class="note__timestamp">February 13th 2023</div>

Instead of manually canceling previous submissions, you can now automatically expire the previous build in TestFlight beta review or cancel the submission pending App Store review when publishing a new version of your app. Learn more in [documentation](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-publishing/app-store-connect/).


## Build artifact URLs in email and Slack expire in 24h
<div class="note__timestamp">February 1st 2023</div>

To minimize the risks associated with sharing build artifacts with unauthenticated users, we have now set the build artifact download links in email and Slack notifications to expire in 24 hours. Previous non-expiring artifact URLs in emails and Slack are no longer accessible for unauthenticated users. Likewise, build artifact links and QR codes on [build dashboards](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-publishing/build-dashboards/) expire in 24 hours but are regenerated upon page refresh. 

All build artifacts remain accessible for authenticated users in Codemagic UI and via the Codemagic API. You can use the [Codemagic API](https://docs.codemagic.io/rest-api/artifacts/) to generate public artifact download URLs with a custom expiration date.

## Advanced branch and tag patterns
<div class="note__timestamp">January 17th 2023</div>

We now support [advanced pattern syntax](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/fnmatch/) to match branch or tag names for automatic build triggering. For example, you can use `v+([0-9]).+([0-9]).+([0-9])` to match tags like `v0.0.42`. See more pattern examples in our [documentation](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-running-builds/starting-builds-automatically/#pattern-examples).
