Webhooks are necessary in order to be able to trigger builds automatically in response to events in the repository.

The payload URL has the following format: `https://api.codemagic.io/hooks/<appId>`.

You can find your app ID in the browser URL after `app/` when you open the app on Codemagic: `https://codemagic.io/app/<appId>`


All received webhooks are visible in the Codemagic UI when navigating to your application and selecting the **Webhooks** tab.

After configuring **Webhooks**, automatic build triggering can be set up as explained [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/flutter-configuration/automatic-build-triggering/). More information about how to set up automatic build triggering in the **yaml** file can be found [here](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml/yaml-getting-started/#triggering).

## Setting up webhooks for Github

Open your project and navigate to **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Add webhook**, paste the **payload URL** from above (both `application/json` or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` are supported as the **Content type**), and select the following events: **Branch or tag creation**, **Pull requests**, **Pushes**.

## Setting up webhooks for GitLab

Navigate to **Settings** > **Webhooks**, paste the **payload URL** and check the following boxes in the **Trigger** section: **Push events**, **Tag push events**, **Merge request events**. Also, be sure to enable **SSL verification**.

## Setting up webhooks for Bitbucket

Open your application repository, go to **Settings** > **Webhooks** (in **Workflow** section) > **Add webhook**, then enter an arbitrary title for the webhook and paste the **payload URL** in the **URL** field. For **Triggers**, select **Choose from a full list of triggers** and select the following events: **Push** in the **Repository** section and **Created**, **Updated**, **Merged** in the **Pull Request** section.

## Setting up webhooks for AWS CodeCommit

To start using webhooks with **AWS CodeCommit**, it is first necessary to create a subscription with the **AWS Simple Notification Service**.

### Configuring the subscription

1. Open up **AWS Simple Notification Service** in the **AWS Console**.
2. Navigate to **Topics** > **Create topic**.
3. Set the type to **Standard**, give the topic a name and click on **Create topic**.
4. Navigate to **Subscriptions** > **Create subscription**.
5. Select the previously configured topic, set the protocol to `HTTPS`, and set the Codemagic **payload URL** as the endpoint. 
6. Confirm that **Enable raw message delivery** is unticked.
7. Proceed by clicking **Create subscription**.
8. In the Codemagic UI, navigate to your application and select the **Webhooks** tab.
9. Under **Recent deliveries**, choose the most recent webhook, and copy the subscription link under the **Results** tab to your browser.

### Configuring webhook events

Open your application repository and navigate to **Notify** > **Create notification rule** and enter a name for your Notification rule.

Under **Events that trigger notifications**, select the **Source updated** and **Created** events in the **Pull request** section and the **Created** and **Updated** events in the **Branches and tags** section.

Set the target type to **SNS topic**, select a configured target and click on **Submit**.

If, after triggering a build, the SNS Notification target status shows as **Unreachable**, navigate to the topic settings and modify the access policy to match the following structure:

{{< highlight json "style=paraiso-dark">}}
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CodeNotification_publish",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "codestar-notifications.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:REPOSITORY"
    }
  ]
}
{{< /highlight >}}


The **Resource** field should match the ARN of the topic.

## Setting up webhooks for Azure DevOps

Open your application repository, go to **Project Settings** > **Service Hooks**, click on **Create a new subscription...** and select **Web Hooks**. Under **Trigger on this type of event**, choose the event you wish to trigger builds for. Codemagic supports **Code pushed**, **Pull request created**, and **Pull request updated** events. In Azure, each of the events requires its own webhook. Once the event has been selected, choose your repository under filters and configure any additional settings.
