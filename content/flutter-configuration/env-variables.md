Environment variables are useful for making available for Codemagic the credentials, configuration files or API keys that are required for successful building or integration with external services. For more information about the use of environment variables and a list of Codemagic read-only environment variables, refer [here](../yaml-basic-configuration/environment-variables).


## Adding environment variables

You can add environment variables to your Flutter projects in **App settings > Environment variables**.

1. Enter the name and the value of the variable.
2. Check **Secure** if you wish to hide the value both in the UI and in build logs and disable editing of the variable. Such variables can be accessed only by the build machines during the build.
3. Click **Add**.


## Storing binary files

In order to store **_binary files_** as environment variables, they first need to be **_base64 encoded_** locally. To use the files, you will have to decode them during the build.

Commonly used binary files that need to be base64 encoded include:
- Android keystore (.jks or .keystore)
- Provisioning profiles when manual code signing (.mobileprovision)
- iOS distribution certificate (.p12) when manual code signing.

The following examples show how to save a file named `codemagic.keystore` depending on your OS:

{{< tabpane >}}

{{< tab header="Linux" >}}
{{<markdown>}}
For Linux machines, we recommend installing xclip:

{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
sudo apt-get install xclip
cat codemagic.keystore | base64 | xclip -selection clipboard
{{< /highlight >}}

Alternatively, you can run the following command and carefully copy/paste the output:
{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
openssl base64 -in codemagic.keystore
{{< /highlight >}}
{{</markdown>}}

{{<notebox>}}
**Tip**: When copying file contents always include any tags. e.g. Don't forget to copy `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` too.
{{</notebox>}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab header="macOS" >}}
{{<markdown>}}
On macOS, running the following command base64 encodes the file and copies the result to the clipboard:
{{< highlight Shell "style=rrt">}}
cat codemagic.keystore | base64 | pbcopy
{{< /highlight >}}
{{</markdown>}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab header="Windows" >}}
{{<markdown>}}
For Windows, the PowerShell command to base64 encode a file and copy it to the clipboard is:
{{< highlight powershell "style=rrt">}}
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("codemagic.keystore")) | Set-Clipboard
{{< /highlight >}}
{{</markdown>}}
{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabpane >}}


After running these command lines, you can paste the automatically copied string into the Variable value field in Codemagic UI.

{{<notebox>}}
**Tip**: A convenient way to check if a file is binary is to try to peek into the file using `less filename.extension`. If it is binary, you'll be asked "**_filename maybe is a binary file.  See it anyway?_**"
{{</notebox>}}

#### Using binary files

In order to use binary files during the build time, you need to `base64` decode them and generate the file again. This can be performed with a simple `echo` command in a script.

{{< highlight bash "style=paraiso-dark">}}
  echo $YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE | base64 --decode > /path/to/decode/to/codemagic.keystore
{{< /highlight >}}
